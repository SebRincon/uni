Canvas LMS

Welcome to Our New API Docs! This is the new home for all things API (previously at Canvas LMS REST API Documentation).
Welcome to the Canvas LMS API Documentation

Canvas LMS includes a REST API for accessing and modifying data externally from the main application, in your own programs and scripts. This documentation describes the resources that make up the API.

To get started, you'll want to review the general basics, including the information below and the page on Authentication using OAuth2.
API Changes

For API resources, such as the API Change Log for additions, changes, deprecations, and removals, view the Canvas API page in the Canvas Community.
API Policy

Please carefully review the Canvas API Policy before using the API.
Schema

All API access is over HTTPS, against your normal Canvas domain.

All API responses are in JSON format.

All integer ids in Canvas are 64 bit integers. String ids are also used in Canvas.

To force all ids to strings add the request header Accept: application/json+canvas-string-ids This will cause Canvas to return even integer IDs as strings, preventing problems with languages (particularly JavaScript) that can't properly process large integers.

All boolean parameters can be passed as true/false, t/f, yes/no, y/n, on/off, or 1/0. When using JSON format, a literal true/false is preferred, rather than as a string.

For POST and PUT requests, parameters are sent using standard HTML form encoding (the application/x-www-form-urlencoded content type).

POST and PUT requests may also optionally be sent in JSON format format. The content-type of the request must be set to application/json in this case. There is currently no way to upload a file as part of a JSON POST, the multipart form type must be used.

As an example, this HTML form request:

name=test+name&file_ids[]=1&file_ids[]=2&sub[name]=foo&sub[message]=bar&flag=y

would translate into this JSON request:

{ "name": "test name", "file_ids": [1,2], "sub": { "name": "foo", "message": "bar" }, "flag": true }

With either encoding, all timestamps are sent and returned in ISO 8601 format (UTC time zone):

YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ

Authentication

API authentication is done with OAuth2. If possible, using the HTTP Authorization header is recommended. Sending the access token in the query string or POST parameters is also supported.

OAuth2 Token sent in header:

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS-TOKEN>" "https://canvas.instructure.com/api/v1/courses"

OAuth2 Token sent in query string:

curl "https://canvas.instructure.com/api/v1/courses?access_token=<ACCESS-TOKEN>"

Read more about OAuth2 and how to get access tokens.
SSL

Note that if you make an API call using HTTP instead of HTTPS, you will be redirected to HTTPS. However, at that point, the credentials have already been sent in clear over the internet. Please make sure that you are using HTTPS.
Canvas Experiences

Canvas LMS supports several experiences including Canvas Career and Canvas for Elementary. The vast majority of these API resources are shared, though some are applicable only to certain experiences.

Basics

GraphQL

Welcome to Our New API Docs! This is the new home for all things API (previously at Canvas LMS REST API Documentation).
GraphQL API
GraphQL Introduction

GraphQL is a query API language that executes queries by using a type system based on defined input data. GraphQL provides more specific inquiries with faster results and populate multiple inputs into one query.

Note: GraphQL endpoint permissions mirror permissions for the REST API. A user is only granted access to view grades based on that user’s permissions. For instance, a student cannot view grades for another student, but an instructor can view grades for any student in a course.

Learn more about GraphQL.
Using GraphQL

Canvas has included the tool GraphiQL, an in-browser graphical interface for interacting with GraphQL endpoints.

The GraphiQL interface can be viewed by adding /graphiql to the end of your Canvas production URL (e.g. your-institution.instructure.com/graphiql).

The /graphiql access can also be added to a test or beta environment URL. Requests from the selected environment will always return that environment’s data.

The Explorer sidebar displays all available queries and mutations. Any selected items display in the GraphiQL window. Once a query or mutation is selected, any values displayed in purple text identify the value as an input argument.
REST vs GraphQL

The Canvas REST API will continue to be available.

Fields are being added to the GraphQL API on an as-needed basis. The GraphQL API does not include everything that is currently in the REST API. Feel free to submit pull requests on github to add additional features or talk about it in the #canvas-lms channel on libera.chat.
GraphQL Endpoint
POST /api/graphql

All GraphQL queries are posted to this endpoint.

Request Parameters
Parameter
Type
Description

query

string

the GraphQL query to execute

variables

Hash

variable values as required by the supplied query

Example Request:

curl https://<canvas>/api/graphql \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  -d query='query courseInfo($courseId: ID!) {
       course(id: $courseId) {
        id
        _id
        name
       }
     }' \
  -d variables[courseId]=1

Example Response

{
  "data": {
    "course": {
      "id": "Q291cnNlLTE=",
      "_id": "1",
      "name": "Mr. Ratburn's Class"
    }
  }
}

GraphQL in Canvas
id vs _id and the node field

The Canvas LMS GraphQL API follows the Relay Object Identification spec. Querying for an object's id will return a global identifier instead of the numeric ids that are used in the REST API. The traditional ids can be queried by requesting the _id field.

Most objects can be fetched by passing their GraphQL id to the node field:

{
  node(id: "Q291cnNlLTE=") {
    ... on Course {
      _id  #  traditional ids (e.g. "1")
      name
      term { name }
    }
  }
}

A legacyNode field is also available to fetch objects via the REST-style ids:

{
  # object type must be specified when using legacyNode
  legacyNode(type: Course, _id: "1") {
    ... on Course {
      _id
      name
    }
  }
}

For commonly accessed object types, type-specific fields are provided:

{
  # NOTE: id arguments will always take either GraphQL or rest-style ids
  c1: course(id: "1") {
    _id
    name
  }
  c2: course(id: "Q291cnNlLTE=") {
    _id
    name
  }
}

Pagination

Canvas follows the Relay Connection Spec for paginating collections. Request reasonable page sizes to avoid being limited.

{
  course(id: "1") {
    assignmentsConnection(
      first: 10,      # page size
      after: "XYZ"    # `endCursor` from previous page
    ) {
      nodes {
        id
        name
      }
      pageInfo {
        endCursor     # this is your `after` value for the next request
        hasNextPage
      }
    }
  }
}

SIS IDs

Welcome to Our New API Docs! This is the new home for all things API (previously at Canvas LMS REST API Documentation).
Object IDs, SIS IDs, and special IDs

Throughout the API, objects are referenced by internal IDs. You can also reference objects by SIS ID, by prepending the SIS ID with the name of the SIS field, like sis_course_id:. For instance, to retrieve the list of assignments for a course with SIS ID of A1234:

/api/v1/courses/sis_course_id:A1234/assignments

The following objects support SIS IDs in the API:

    sis_account_id

    sis_course_id

    sis_group_id

    sis_group_category_id

    sis_integration_id (for users and courses)

    sis_login_id

    sis_section_id

    sis_term_id

    sis_user_id

Some objects support LTI IDs:

    lti_context_id (for accounts, assignments, courses, groups, and users)

    lti_1_1_id (for users, an alias of lti_context_id, which is sent in LTI 1.1 launches as user_id)

    lti_1_3_id (for users, a separate value from lti_context_id, sent in LTI 1.3 launches as sub)

Additionally, some objects support special IDs:

    Users support self to mean the current user.

    Accounts support self to mean the root account for the current domain, default to mean the Default account, and site_admin to mean the Site Admin account.

    Terms support default to mean the default term, and current to mean the term that is currently active according to term dates. A term must have a start date or an end date to be considered the current term. If there is more than one term that's active, current will not be found.

Encoding and Escaping

SIS IDs should be encoded as UTF-8, and then escaped normally for inclusion in a URI. For instance the SIS ID CS/101.11é is encoded and escaped as CS%2F101%2E11%C3%A9.

Note that some web servers have difficulties with escaped characters, particularly forward slashes. They may require special configuration to properly pass encoded slashes to Rails.

For Apache and Passenger, the following settings should be set:

    AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode

    PassengerAllowEncodedSlashes on

Also beware that if you use ProxyPass, you should enable the nocanon option. Similarly, RewriteRule should use the NE, or noescape flag. Other modules may also need additional configuration to prevent double-escaping of %2f (/) as %252f.

Prior versions of this API documentation described using a hex encoding to circumvent these issues, since the proper Apache/Passenger configuration was not known at the time. This format is deprecated, and will no longer be described, but will continue to be handled by the server for backwards compatibility.

This documentation is generated directly from the Canvas LMS source code, available on Github.
Pagination

Welcome to Our New API Docs! This is the new home for all things API (previously at Canvas LMS REST API Documentation).
Pagination

Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 10 items by default. You can set a custom per-page amount with the ?per_page parameter. There is an unspecified limit to how big you can set per_page to, so be sure to always check for the Link header.

To retrieve additional pages, the returned Link headers should be used. These links should be treated as opaque. They will be absolute urls that include all parameters necessary to retrieve the desired current, next, previous, first, or last page. The one exception is that if an access_token parameter is sent for authentication, it will not be included in the returned links, and must be re-appended.

Pagination information is provided in the Link header:

Link: <https://<canvas>/api/v1/courses/:id/discussion_topics.json?opaqueA>; rel="current",
      <https://<canvas>/api/v1/courses/:id/discussion_topics.json?opaqueB>; rel="next",
      <https://<canvas>/api/v1/courses/:id/discussion_topics.json?opaqueC>; rel="first",
      <https://<canvas>/api/v1/courses/:id/discussion_topics.json?opaqueD>; rel="last"

The possible rel values are:

    current - link to the current page of results.

    next - link to the next page of results.

    prev - link to the previous page of results.

    first - link to the first page of results.

    last - link to the last page of results.

These will only be included if they are relevant. For example, the first page of results will not contain a rel="prev" link. rel="last" may also be excluded if the total count is too expensive to compute on each request.

NOTE: Because HTTP header names are case-insensitive, please be sure you are not parsing the Link header in a case-sensitive way. The capitalization of the header name is not guaranteed.

This documentation is generated directly from the Canvas LMS source code, available on Github.
Throttling

Welcome to Our New API Docs! This is the new home for all things API (previously at Canvas LMS REST API Documentation).
Throttling

Canvas includes a built in dynamic throttling mechanism to prevent a single user from abusing the system and causing adverse effects for others. It works by having a rate limit, and a cost for every request. Each request subtracts from your quota, and the quota is automatically replenished over time. In the event that your API request is throttled, you will receive a 403 Forbidden (Rate Limit Exceeded) response. Your application should be prepared for this error, and retry the request at a later time.

To assist applications with planning, every request will return a X-Request-Cost header that is a floating point number of the amount that request deducted from your remaining quota. If throttling is applicable to this request, there will also be a X-Rate-Limit-Remaining header of your remaining quota.

Since the cost of a request is roughly based on the amount of time it takes to process, and the quota (by default) replenishes at a rate faster than real-time, any API client that makes no more than one simultaneous request is unlikely to be throttled. Parallel requests are subject to an additional pre-flight penalty to prevent a large number of incoming requests being able to bring the system down before their cost is counted against their quota. As soon as each request finishes, the pre-flight penalty is credited back to the quota, and only the actual cost of the request is counted.

For applications that go through the OAuth flow and obtain an access token for each user, each access token has its own quota, and the developer need not be concerned with requests from one user causing another user to be throttled.

This documentation is generated directly from the Canvas LMS source code, available on Github.
Compound Documents

Welcome to Our New API Docs! This is the new home for all things API (previously at Canvas LMS REST API Documentation).
Compound Documents

Compound documents contain multiple collections to allow for side-loading of related objects. Side-loading is desirable when nested representation of related objects would result in potentially expensive repetition. For example, given a list of 50 comments by only 3 authors, a nested representation would include 50 author objects where a side-loaded representation would contain only 3 author objects.

A compound document is a JSON object with two reserved properties ("meta" and "links"). The "meta" property is required and is described below; the "links" property is currently unused but reserved. All other properties of the compound document's root object should be interpreted as collections of model objects. A compound document will always contain at least one collection.

The "meta" property is a JSON object with one recognized property ("primaryCollection"). If present, the "meta.primaryCollection" property will contain the property name of one of the collections in the compound document. The primary collection contains the data most directly associated with the request. Any pagination indicated through a Link header accompanying a compound document applies to the primary collection.

Any remaining collections in a compound document are secondary collections and will contain objects related (perhaps indirectly, through other secondary objects) to those in the primary collection. Secondary collections should never be considered as ordered or complete.

Example:

{
  "meta": {"primaryCollection": "comments"},
  "comments": [...],
  "authors": [...]
}

File Uploads

Welcome to Our New API Docs! This is the new home for all things API (previously at Canvas LMS REST API Documentation).
Uploading Files

There are two ways to upload a file to Canvas: either by sending the file data in a POST request, or by sending Canvas a publicly accessible HTTP or HTTPS URL to the file.
Uploading via POST

There are three steps to uploading a file directly via POST:

    Notify Canvas that you are uploading a file with a POST to the file creation endpoint. This POST will include the file name and file size, along with information about what context the file is being created in.

    Upload the file using the information returned in the first POST request.

    On successful upload, the API will respond with a redirect. This redirect needs to be followed to complete the upload, or the file may not appear.

Step 1: Telling Canvas about the file upload and getting a token

The first step is to POST to the relevant API endpoint, depending on where you want to create the file. For example, to add a file to a course, you'd POST to /api/v1/courses/:course_id/files. Or to upload a file as part of a student homework submission, as the student you'd POST to /api/v1/courses/:course_id/assignments/:assignment_id/submissions/self/files or /api/v1/courses/:course_id/assignments/:assignment_id/submissions/comments/self/files for submission comments.

Note* The endpoint you choose to post files to will change the permissions set on the file. i.e. only files posted to the submissions comments endpoint can be attached to a submissions comment.

Arguments:

    name

    The filename of the file. Any UTF-8 name is allowed. Path components such as `/` and `\` will be treated as part of the filename, not a path to a sub-folder.

    size

    The size of the file, in bytes. This field is recommended, as it will let you find out if there's a quota issue before uploading the raw file.

    content_type

    The content type of the file. If not given, it will be guessed based on the file extension.

    parent_folder_id

    The id of the folder to store the file in. An error will be returned if this does not correspond to an existing folder. If this and parent_folder_path are sent an error will be returned. If neither is given, a default folder will be used.

    parent_folder_path

    The path of the folder to store the file in. The path separator is the forward slash `/`, never a back slash. The folder will be created if it does not already exist. This parameter only applies to file uploads in a context that has folders, such as a user, a course, or a group. If this and parent_folder_id are sent an error will be returned. If neither is given, a default folder will be used.

    folder

    [deprecated] Use parent_folder_path instead.

    on_duplicate

    How to handle duplicate filenames. If `overwrite`, then this file upload will overwrite any other file in the folder with the same name. If `rename`, then this file will be renamed if another file in the folder exists with the given name. If no parameter is given, the default is `overwrite`. This doesn't apply to file uploads in a context that doesn't have folders.

    success_include[]

    An array of additional information to include in the upload success response. See Files API for more information.

Example Request:

curl 'https://<canvas>/api/v1/users/self/files' \
     -F 'name=profile_pic.jpg' \
     -F 'size=302185' \
     -F 'content_type=image/jpeg' \
     -F 'parent_folder_path=my_files/section1' \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

Example Response:

{
  "upload_url": "https://some-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/",
  "upload_params": {
    "key": "/users/1234/files/profile_pic.jpg",
    <unspecified parameters; key above will not necesarily be present either>
  }
}

At this point, the file object has been created in Canvas in a "pending" state, with no content. It will not appear in any listings in the UI until the next two steps are completed. The returned Signature is valid for 30 minutes.
Step 2: Upload the file data to the URL given in the previous response

Using the data in the JSON response from Step 1, the application can now upload the actual file data, by POSTing a specially formulated request to the URL given in the upload_url field of the response.

Depending on how Canvas is configured, this upload URL might be another URL in the same domain, or a Amazon S3 bucket, or some other URL. In order to work with all Canvas installations, applications should be very careful to follow this documentation and not make any undocumented assumptions about the upload workflow.

This second request must be POSTed as a multipart/form-data request to accomodate the file data. The parameters POSTed with this request come directly from the upload_params part of the JSON response in Step 1.

The only addition is the file parameter which must be posted as the last parameter following all the others.

Example Request:

curl '<upload_url>' \
     -F 'key=/users/1234/files/profile_pic.jpg' \
     <any other parameters specified in the upload_params response>
     -F 'file=@my_local_file.jpg'

The access token is not sent with this request.

Example Response:

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: https://<canvas>/api/v1/files/1234/create_success?uuid=ABCDE

IMPORTANT: The request is signed, and will be denied if any parameters from the upload_params response are added, removed or modified. The parameters in upload_params may vary over time, and between Canvas installs. It's important for the application to copy over all of the parameters, and not rely on the names or values of the params for any functionality.

This example assumes there is a file called my_local_file.jpg in the current directory.
Step 3: Confirm the upload's success

If Step 2 is successful, the response will be either a 3XX redirect or 201 Created with a Location header set as normal.

In the case of a 3XX redirect, the application needs to perform a GET to this location in order to complete the upload, otherwise the new file may not be marked as available. (Note: While a POST would be truer to REST semantics, a GET is required for forwards compatibility with the 201 Created response described below.) This request is back against Canvas again, and needs to be authenticated using the normal API access token authentication.

In the case of a 201 Created, the upload has been complete and the Canvas JSON representation of the file can be retrieved with a GET from the provided Location.

Example Request:

curl -X POST '<Location>' \
     -H 'Content-Length: 0' \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

Example Response:

{
  "id": 1234,
  "url": "...url to download the file...",
  "content-type": "image/jpeg",
  "display_name": "profile_pic.jpg",
  "size": 302185
}

Uploading via URL

Instead of uploading a file directly, you can also provide Canvas a public HTTP or HTTPS URL from which to retrieve the file.
Step 1a: Posting the file URL to Canvas

The first step is the same as with the "Uploading via POST" flow above, with the addition of a few new parameters:

    url

    The full URL to the file to be uploaded. This URL must be publicly accessible.

    submit_assignment

    A boolean to indicate whether or not to automatically submit the assignment the file is associated with if it is associated with an assignment. Defaults to true.

Example Request:

curl 'https://<canvas>/api/v1/users/self/files' \
     -F 'url=http://example.com/my_pic.jpg' \
     -F 'name=profile_pic.jpg' \
     -F 'size=302185' \
     -F 'content_type=image/jpeg' \
     -F 'parent_folder_path=my_files/section1' \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

Example Response:

{
  "upload_url": "https://file-service.url/opaque",
  "upload_params": {
    /* unspecified parameters; contents should be treated as opaque */
  },
  "progress": {
    /* amongst other tags, see the Progress API... */
    "url": "https://canvas.example.edu/api/v1/progress/1"
    "workflow_state": "running"
  }
}

Step 1b: Understanding the response

Canvas' file management is in a moment of transition. For the duration of this transition, there are two possible behaviors. The newer behavior includes additional fields in the response to the first request and expects an additional action from the application.

In the deprecated behavior, Canvas will initiate a "cloning" of the provided URL by downloading it via Canvas servers. The initial POST was sufficient to start this and no other action is necessary from the application.

In the newer behavior, Canvas delegates the cloning of the URL to the same service that accepts direct uploads. The cloning is kicked off by a POST by the application to the provided upload_url with the provided upload_params, in parallel with a direct upload. The service then informs Canvas directly when it is complete.

In either case, the cloning of the URL will be performed in the background, and the file will not necessarily be immediately available when the API calls complete. Instead, a progress object is provided which can be periodically polled to check the status of the upload.

You can distinguish the new behavior (and expected follow up) from the old behavior precisely by the presence or absence of the upload_url key.
Step 2: POST to the URL given in the previous response

If the response to the initial POST includes an upload_url, you must POST to it with the upload_params just as if you were performing a direct upload. The only exception is that the file parameter is omitted. The Content-Type is still expected to be multipart/form-data.

Example Request:

curl '<upload_url>' \
     -F 'target_url=http://example.com/my_pic.jpg' \
     <any other parameters specified in the upload_params response>

Example Response:

HTTP/1.1 201 Created

This step is not necessary with the old behavior.
Step 3: Check to see when the upload is complete

If the application needs to know the outcome of the upload, it can use the {api:ProgressController#Show Progress endpoint} to query the status. On success, the created attachment's id will be returned in the results of the Progress object as id.

API Endpoint Attributes

Welcome to Our New API Docs! This is the new home for all things API (previously at Canvas LMS REST API Documentation).
API Endpoint Attributes

Canvas adds attributes to links in returned HTML snippets to make it easier for API consumers to digest the referenced resources. These attributes are as follows:

    data-api-endpoint - A URL where the linked object can be accessed via the API

    data-api-returntype - The type of data returned

For example, consider an assignment description containing a link to a wiki page in the same course. The description returned by the Get Assignment API might look like this:

<a href="http://canvas.example.com/courses/123/pages/a-wiki-page"
   data-api-endpoint="http://canvas.example.com/api/v1/courses/123/pages/a-wiki-page"
   data-api-returntype="Page">More information here</a>

The currently supported data-api-returntype values are:

    Assignment

    Discussion

    Page

    File

    Folder

    Quiz

    Module

    SessionlessLaunchUrl

If the API returns a list of objects instead of a single object, the data-api-returntype will be wrapped in square brackets, e.g. [Assignment].

Masquerading

Welcome to Our New API Docs! This is the new home for all things API (previously at Canvas LMS REST API Documentation).
Masquerading

Masquerading is making an API call on behalf of another user. It will behave as if the target user had made the API call with their own access token (even if they don't have one), including permission checks, enrollments, etc. In order to masquerade via the API, the calling user must have the "Become other users" permission. If the target user is also an admin, the calling user must additionally have every permission that the target user has. For auditing purposes, all calls log both the calling user and the target user.

To masquerade, add an as_user_id parameter to any request. It can be either a Canvas user ID, or an SIS user ID (as described in SIS IDs):

curl 'https://<canvas>/api/v1/users/self/activity_stream?as_user_id=sis_user_id:brian' \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

Masquerading could be useful in a number of use cases:

    For developing an admin tool

    For accessing APIs that can only be called on self (i.e. the activity stream as shown above)

    For a portal type application that's already tightly integrated with an SIS and is managed by the school, to avoid going through the OAuth flow for every student

OAuth2

OAuth2 Overview

Welcome to Our New API Docs! This is the new home for all things API (previously at Canvas LMS REST API Documentation).
OAuth2

Developer keys issued after Oct 2015 generate tokens with a 1 hour expiration. Applications must use refresh tokens to generate new access tokens.

OAuth2 is a protocol designed to let third-party applications authenticate to perform actions as a user, without getting the user's password. Canvas uses OAuth2 (specifically RFC-6749) for authentication and authorization of the Canvas API. Additionally, Canvas uses OAuth2 for LTI Advantage service authentication (as described in the IMS Security Framework).

Accessing the Canvas API

Back to Top
Storing Tokens

Back to Top

When appropriate, applications should store the token locally, rather than requesting a new token for the same user each time the user uses the application. If the token is deleted or expires, the application will get a 401 Unauthorized error from the API, in which case the application should perform the OAuth flow again to receive a new token. You can differentiate this 401 Unauthorized from other cases where the user simply does not have permission to access the resource by checking that the WWW-Authenticate header is set.

Storing a token is in many ways equivalent to storing the user's password, so tokens should be stored and used in a secure manner, including but not limited to:

    Don't embed tokens in web pages.

    Don't pass tokens or session IDs around in URLs.

    Properly secure the database or other data store containing the tokens.

    For web applications, practice proper techniques to avoid session attacks such as cross-site scripting, request forgery, replay attacks, etc.

    For native applications, take advantage of user keychain stores and other operating system functionality for securely storing passwords.

Manual Token Generation

Back to Top

For testing your application before you've implemented OAuth, the simplest option is to generate an access token on your user's profile page. Note that asking any other user to manually generate a token and enter it into your application is a violation of Canvas' API Policy. Applications in use by multiple users MUST use OAuth to obtain tokens.

To manually generate a token for testing:

    Click the "profile" link in the top right menu bar, or navigate to /profile

    Under the "Approved Integrations" section, click the button to generate a new access token.

    Once the token is generated, you cannot view it again, and you'll have to generate a new token if you forget it. Remember that access tokens are password equivalent, so keep it secret.

Oauth2 Flow

Back to Top

Your application can rely on canvas for a user's identity. During step 1 of the web application flow below, specify the optional scope parameter as scope=/auth/userinfo. When the user is asked to grant your application access in step 2 of the web application flow, they will also be given an option to remember their authorization. If they grant access and remember the authorization, Canvas will skip step 2 of the request flow for future requests.

Canvas will not give a token back as part of a userinfo request. It will only provide the current user's name and id.
Getting OAuth2 Client ID/Secret

If your application will be used by others, you will need to implement the full OAuth2 token request workflow, so that you can request an access token for each user of your application.

Performing the OAuth2 token request flow requires an application client ID and client secret. To obtain these application credentials, you will need to register your application. The client secret should never be shared.

For Canvas Cloud (hosted by Instructure), developer keys are issued by the admin of the institution.

NOTE for LTI providers: Since developer keys are scoped to the institution they are issued from, tool providers that serve multiple institutions should store and look up the correct developer key based on the launch parameters (eg. custom_canvas_api_domain) sent during the LTI launch.

For open source Canvas users, you can generate a client ID and secret in the Site Admin account of your Canvas install.
Step 1: Redirect users to request Canvas access

Back to Top

A basic request looks like:
GET https://<canvas-install-url>/login/oauth2/auth?client_id=XXX&response_type=code&state=YYY&redirect_uri=https://example.com/oauth2response

See GET login/oauth2/auth for details.
Step 2: Redirect back to the request_uri, or out-of-band redirect

Back to Top

If the user accepts your request, Canvas redirects back to your request_uri with a specific query string, containing the OAuth2 response:
http://www.example.com/oauth2response?code=XXX&state=YYY

The app can then extract the code, and use it along with the client_id and client_secret to obtain the final access_key.

If your application passed a state parameter in step 1, it will be returned here in step 2 so that your app can tie the request and response together, whether the response was successful or an error occurred.

If the user doesn't accept the request for access, or if another error occurs, Canvas redirects back to your request_uri with an error parameter, rather than a code parameter, in the query string.
http://www.example.com/oauth2response?error=access_denied&error_description=a_description&state=YYY

A list of possible error codes is found in the RFC-7649 spec.
Note for native apps

Back to Top

Canvas redirects to a page on canvas with a specific query string, containing parameters from the OAuth2 response:

/login/oauth2/auth?code=<code>

/login/oauth2/auth?code=<code>

At this point the app should notice that the URL of the webview has changed to contain code=<code> somewhere in the query string. The app can then extract the code, and use it along with the client_id and client_secret to obtain the final access_key.
Step 3: Exchange the code for the final access token

Back to Top

To get a new access token and refresh token, send a POST request to login/oauth2/token with the following parameters:

Parameters
Parameter
Value

grant_type

authorization_code

client_id

Your client_id

client_secret

Your client_secret

redirect_uri

If a redirect_uri was passed to the initial request in step 1, the same redirect_uri must be given here.

code

code from canvas

replace_tokens

(optional) If this option is set to `1`, existing access tokens issued for this developer key/secret will be destroyed and replaced with the new token that is returned from this request

Note that the once the code issued in step 2 is used in a POST request to this endpoint, it is invalidated and further requests for tokens with the same code will fail.
Using an Access Token to authenticate requests

Back to Top

Once you have an OAuth access token, you can use it to make API requests. If possible, using the HTTP Authorization header is recommended.

OAuth2 Token sent in header:

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS-TOKEN>" "https://canvas.instructure.com/api/v1/courses"

Sending the access token in the query string or POST parameters is also supported, but discouraged as it increases the chances of the token being logged or leaked in transit.

OAuth2 Token sent in query string:

curl "https://canvas.instructure.com/api/v1/courses?access_token=<ACCESS-TOKEN>"

Using a Refresh Token to get a new Access Token

Back to Top

Access tokens have a 1 hour lifespan. When the refresh flow is taken, Canvas will update the access token to a new value, reset the expiration timer, and return the new access token as part of the response. When refreshing tokens the user will not be asked to authorize the application again.

To refresh the access token, send a POST request to login/oauth2/token with the following parameters:

Parameters
Parameter
Value

grant_type

refresh_token

client_id

Your client_id

client_secret

Your client_secret

refresh_token

refresh_token from initial access_token request

The response to this request will not contain a new refresh token; the same refresh token is to be reused.
Logging Out

Back to Top

To logout, simply send a DELETE request to login/oauth2/token
Accessing LTI Advantage Services

Back to Top

LTI Advantage services, such as Names and Role Provisioning Services and Assignment and Grade Services, require use of a client credentials grant flow for request authentication. This workflow is best summarized on the IMS Security Framework (specifically Section 4).

Our goal here is to highlight some nuances that might help you access these services in Canvas, rather than describing the specification in detail.
Step 1: Developer Key Setup

Back to Top

Before the client_credentials grant flow can be achieved, an LTI developer key must be created. During developer key configuration, a public JWK can either be configured statically or can be dynamically rotated by providing JWKs by a URL that Canvas can reach. Tools may also use a previously issued client_credentials token to retroactively rotate the public JWK via an API request. The JWK must include an alg and use.

Example JWK

   "public_jwk": {
      "kty":"RSA",
      "alg":"RS256",
      "e":"AQAB",
      "kid":"8f796179-7ac4-48a3-a202-fc4f3d814fcd",
      "n":"nZA7QWcIwj-3N_RZ1qJjX6CdibU87y2l02yMay4KunambalP9g0fU9yILwLX9WYJINcXZDUf6QeZ-SSbblET-h8Q4OvfSQ7iuu0WqcvBGy8M0qoZ7I-NiChw8dyybMJHgpiP_AyxpCQnp3bQ6829kb3fopbb4cAkOilwVRBYPhRLboXma0cwcllJHPLvMp1oGa7Ad8osmmJhXhN9qdFFASg_OCQdPnYVzp8gOFeOGwlXfSFEgt5vgeU25E-ycUOREcnP7BnMUk7wpwYqlE537LWGOV5z_1Dqcqc9LmN-z4HmNV7b23QZW4_mzKIOY4IqjmnUGgLU9ycFj5YGDCts7Q",
      "use":"sig"
   }
  

Step 2: Request an access token

Back to Top

Once the developer key is configured and turned on, your tool can request an LTI access token using the client_credentials grant. This request must be signed by an RSA256 private key with a public key that is configured on the developer key as described in Step 1: Developer Key Setup.
Step 3: Use the access token to access LTI services

Back to Top

Once you have an access token, you can use it to make LTI service requests. The access token must be included as a Bearer token in the Authorization header:

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS-TOKEN>" "https://<canvas_domain>/api/lti/courses/:course_id/names_and_roles"

Access tokens only work in the context of where a tool has been deployed. Tools can only access line items that are associated with their tool.

The following endpoints are currently supported:
Names and Role Provisioning Services

    Names and Role API

Assignment and Grade Services

    Line Items

OAuth2 Endpoints

Welcome to Our New API Docs! This is the new home for all things API (previously at Canvas LMS REST API Documentation).
OAuth2 Endpoints

Developer keys issued after Oct 2015 generate tokens with a 1 hour expiration. Applications must use refresh tokens to generate new access tokens.

    GET login/oauth2/auth

    POST login/oauth2/token

    DELETE login/oauth2/token

    GET login/session_token

GET login/oauth2/auth
GET https://<canvas-install-url>/login/oauth2/auth?client_id=XXX&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://example.com/oauth_complete&state=YYY&scope=<value_1>%20<value_2>%20<value_n>

Parameters
Parameter
Required
Description

client_id

Required

The client id for your registered application.

response_type

Required

The type of OAuth2 response requested. The only currently supported value is code.

redirect_uri

Required

The URL where the user will be redirected after authorization. The domain of this URL must match the domain of the redirect_uri stored on the developer key, or it must be a subdomain of that domain. For native applications, currently the only supported value is urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob, signifying that the credentials will be retrieved out-of-band using an embedded browser or other functionality.

state

Optional

Your application can pass Canvas an arbitrary piece of state in this parameter, which will be passed back to your application in Step 2. It's strongly encouraged that your application pass a unique identifier in the state parameter, and then verify in Step 2 that the state you receive back from Canvas is the same expected value. Failing to do this opens your application to the possibility of logging the wrong person in, as described here.

scope

Optional

This can be used to specify what information the Canvas API access token will provide access to. Canvas API scopes may be found beneath their corresponding endpoints in the "resources" documentation pages. If the developer key does not require scopes and no scope parameter is specified, the access token will have access to all scopes. If the developer key does require scopes and no scope parameter is specified, Canvas will respond with "invalid_scope." To successfully pass multiple scope values, the scope parameter is included once, with multiple values separated by spaces. Passing multiple scope parameters, as is common in other areas of Canvas, causes only the last value to be applied to the generated token.

purpose

Optional

This can be used to help the user identify which instance of an application this token is for. For example, a mobile device application could provide the name of the device.

force_login

Optional

Set to '1' if you want to force the user to enter their credentials, even if they're already logged into Canvas. By default, if a user already has an active Canvas web session, they will not be asked to re-enter their credentials.

unique_id

Optional

Set to the user's username to be populated in the login form in the event that the user must authenticate.

prompt

Optional

If set to none, Canvas will immediately redirect to the redirect_uri. If the caller has a valid session with a "remember me" token or a token from a trusted Developer Key, the redirect will contain a code=XYZ param. If the caller has no session, the redirect will contain an error=login_required param. If the caller has a session, but no "remember me" or trusted token, the redirect will contain an error=interaction_required param.
POST login/oauth2/token

See Section 4.1.3 of the OAuth2 RFC for more information about this process.
POST /login/oauth2/token

Parameters
Parameter
Required
Description

grant_type

Required

Values currently supported: "authorization_code", "refresh_token", and "client_credentials".

client_id

Required for grant_types: authorization_code, refresh_token

The client id for your registered application.

client_secret

Required for grant_types: authorization_code, refresh_token

The client secret for your registered application.

redirect_uri

Required for grant_types: authorization_code, refresh_token

If a redirect_uri was passed to the initial request in step 1, the same redirect_uri must be given here.

code

Required for grant_type: authorization_code

Required if grant_type is authorization_code. The code you received in a redirect response.

refresh_token

Required for grant_type: refresh_token

Required if grant_type is refresh_token. The refresh_token you received in a redirect response.

client_assertion_type

Required for grant_type: client_credentials

Currently the only supported value for this field is `urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer`.

client_assertion

Required for grant_type: client_credentials

The signed jwt used to request an access token. Includes the value of Developer Key id as the sub claim of the jwt body. Should be signed by the private key of the stored public key on the DeveloperKey.

scope

Required for grant_type: client_credentials

A list of scopes to be granted to the token. Currently only IMS defined scopes may be used.

Canvas API example responses

For grant_type of code or refresh_token:
Parameter
Description

access_token

The OAuth2 Canvas API access token.

token_type

The type of token that is returned.

user

A JSON object of canvas user id and user name.

refresh_token

The OAuth2 refresh token.

expires_in

Seconds until the access token expires.

canvas_region

For hosted Canvas, the AWS region (e.g. us-east-1) in which the institution that provided this token resides. For local or open source Canvas, this will have a value of "unknown". This field is safe to ignore.

When using grant_type=code (ex: for Canvas API access):

  {
    "access_token": "1/fFAGRNJru1FTz70BzhT3Zg",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "user": {"id":42, "name": "Jimi Hendrix"},
    "refresh_token": "tIh2YBWGiC0GgGRglT9Ylwv2MnTvy8csfGyfK2PqZmkFYYqYZ0wui4tzI7uBwnN2",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "canvas_region": "us-east-1"
  }
  

When using grant_type=refresh_token, the response will not contain a new refresh token since the same refresh token can be used multiple times:

  {
    "access_token": "1/fFAGRNJru1FTz70BzhT3Zg",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "user": {"id":42, "name": "Jimi Hendrix"},
    "expires_in": 3600
  }
  

If scope=/auth/userinfo was specified in the GET login/oauth2/auth request (ex: when using Canvas as an authentication service) then the response that results from POST login/oauth2/token would be:

  {
    "access_token": null,
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "user":{"id": 42, "name": "Jimi Hendrix"}
  }
  

Examples using client_credentials

When using grant_type=client_credentials (ex: to access LTI Advantage Services):

Example request

This request must be signed by an RSA256 private key with a public key that is configured on the developer key as described in Step 1: Developer Key Setup.

  {
    "grant_type": "client_credentials",
    "client_assertion_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer",
    "client_assertion": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjIwMTktMDYtMjFUMTQ6NTk6MzBaIn0.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5teS10b29sLmNvbSIsInN1YiI6Ilx1MDAzY2NsaWVudF9pZFx1MDAzZSIsImF1ZCI6Imh0dHA6Ly9cdTAwM2NjYW52YXNfZG9tYWluXHUwMDNlL2xvZ2luL29hdXRoMi90b2tlbiIsImlhdCI6MTU2MTc1MDAzMSwiZXhwIjoxNTYxNzUwNjMxLCJqdGkiOiJkZmZkYmRjZS1hOWYxLTQyN2ItOGZjYS02MDQxODIxOTg3ODMifQ.lUHCwDqx2ukKQ2vwoz_824IVcyq-rNdJKVpGUiJea5-Ybk_VfyKW5v0ky-4XTJrGHkDcj0T9J8qKfYbikqyetK44yXx1YGo-2Pn2GEZ26bZxCnuDUDhbqN8OZf4T8DnZsYP4OyhOseHERsHCzKF-SD2_Pk6ES5-Z8J55_aMyS3w3tl4nJtwsMm6FbMDp_FhSGE4xTwkBZ2KNM4JqkCwHGX_9KcpsPsHRFQjn9ysTeg-Qf7H2QFgFMFjsfQX-iSL_bQoC2npSz7rQ8awKMhCEYdMYZk2vVhQ7XQ8ysAyf3m1vlLbHjASpztcAB0lz_DJysT0Ep-Rh311Qf_vXHexjVA",
    "scope": "https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/lti-ags/lineitem https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/lti-ags/result/read"
  }
  

Below is an example of the decoded client_assertion JWT in the above request:

  //Header
  {
    "typ": "JWT",
    "alg": "RS256",
    "kid": "2019-06-21T14:59:30Z"
  }
  //Payload
  {
    "iss": "https://www.my-tool.com",
    "sub": "<client_id>",
    "aud": "https://<canvas_domain>/login/oauth2/token",

    "exp": 1561750631,
    "jti": "dffdbdce-a9f1-427b-8fca-604182198783"
  }
  

NOTE:

    the value of the sub claim should match the client_id of the developer key in Canvas.

    the value of the aud claim should contain either the domain of the Canvas account where the desired data resides, or the domain of the LTI 1.3 OIDC Auth endpoint, as described here.

    if the public key defined on the developer key is a JWK set (specified by an URL) the kid (key ID) value in the signed JWT header must match one of the public keys returned by the public key URL.

DELETE login/oauth2/token

If your application supports logout functionality, you can revoke your own access token. This is useful for security reasons, as well as removing your application from the list of tokens on the user's profile page. Simply make an authenticated request to the following endpoint by including an Authorization header or providing the access_token as a request parameter.
DELETE /login/oauth2/token

Parameters
Parameter
Required
Description

expire_sessions

Optional

Set this to '1' if you want to end all of the user's Canvas web sessions. Without this argument, the endpoint will leave web sessions intact.

Additionally, if the user logged in to Canvas via a delegated authentication provider, and the provider supports Single Log Out functionality, the response will contain a forward_url key. If you are still in control of the user's browsing session, it is recommended to then redirect them to this URL, in order to also log them out from where their session originated. Beware that it is unlikely that control will be returned to your application after this redirect.

Example responses

  {
    "forward_url": "https://idp.school.edu/opaque_url"
  }
  

GET login/session_token

If your application needs to begin a normal web session in order to access features not supported via API (such as quiz taking), you can use your API access token in order to get a time-limited URL that can be fed to a browser or web view to begin a new web session.
GET /login/session_token

Parameters
Parameter
Required
Description

return_to

Optional

An optional URL to begin the web session at. Otherwise the user will be sent to the dashboard.

Example responses

  {
    "session_url": "https://canvas.instructure.com/opaque_url"
  }

Developer Keys

Welcome to Our New API Docs! This is the new home for all things API (previously at Canvas LMS REST API Documentation).
Developer Keys

Developer keys are OAuth2 client ID and secret pairs stored in Canvas that allow third-party applications to request access to Canvas API endpoints via the OAuth2 flow. Access is granted after a user authorizes an app and Canvas creates an API access token that’s returned in the final request of the OAuth2 flow.

Developer keys created in a root account, by root account administrators or Instructure employees, are only functional for the account they are created in and its sub-accounts. Developer keys created globally, by an Instructure employee, are functional in any Canvas account where they are enabled.

By scoping the tokens, Canvas allows root account administrators to manage the specific API endpoints that tokens issued from a developer key have access to.
Developer Key Scopes

Developer key scopes allow root account administrators to restrict the tokens issued from developer keys to a subset of Canvas API endpoints in their account.

Developer keys may be scoped or unscoped. Unscoped keys will have access to all Canvas resources available to the authorizing user. The following applies to scoped developer keys only:
What are developer key scopes in Canvas?

Each Canvas API endpoint has an associated scope. Canvas developer key scopes can only be enabled/disabled by a root account administrator or an Instructure employee.

Scopes take the following form:

url:<HTTP Verb>|<Canvas API Endpoint Path>

For example, the corresponding scope for the GET /api/v1/courses/:course_id/rubrics API endpoint would be

url:GET|/api/v1/courses/:course_id/rubrics

How do developer key scopes function?

When requesting an access token, third-party applications should specify a scope parameter (see the oauth endpoints documentation). The requested scopes must be a subset of the scopes set for the developer key.

When a client makes any API request, Canvas will verify the requested endpoint's scope has been granted by the account administrator to the developer key of the request's access token.

If the requested endpoint's scope has not been granted Canvas will respond with 401 Unauthorized.
Who can grant or revoke scopes for a developer key?

For developer keys created in a specific root account, administrators for that account may grant or revoke scopes. When requesting a developer key, application owners should communicate with administrators which scopes their integrations require.

For global developer keys, an Instructure employee may grant or revoke scopes.

Note: If a scope is removed from a developer key, all access tokens derived from that key will be invalidated. In this case, clients should request a new access token.
Where can I see what scopes are available?

View the complete list of token scopes. Scopes may also be found beneath their corresponding endpoints in the "resources" documentation pages.
Developer Key Management

Developer key management features allow root account administrators to turn global developer keys "on" and "off" for only their account.
What management features are available?

Root account administrators may enable or disable global developer keys for their specific account. This means that vendors who wish to have integrations that work in any Canvas account may request a global developer key from Instructure allowing account administrators enable the key for their account.
How do management features function?

When a client uses the OAuth2 Auth endpoint as part of the flow to retrieve an access token canvas will check the developer key associated with the client_id. If the developer key is not enabled in the requested account, Canvas will respond with unauthorized_client.

When a client makes any API request, Canvas will check the developer key associated with the access token used in the request. If the developer key is not enabled for the requested account, Canvas will respond with 401 Unauthorized.
Other Considerations
Maximum number of scopes

When clients request an access token they may specify what scopes the token needs (see the oauth endpoints documentation). Because the client sends the scopes they require in a GET request, the maximum number of scopes one access token can specify is limited by the maximum HTTP header size Canvas allows (8000 chars).

On average, an access token may use up to 110 scopes. This number will vary depending on the actual length of the scopes used and any other headers sent in the login oauth2 request along with the scopes.

If the number of scopes required by the client exceeds this limitation, a second access token with the remaining scopes should be requested.
Canvas API Includes

Several Canvas APIs allow specifying an include parameter. This parameter allows nesting resources in JSON responses. For example, a request to the assignment index endpoint could be made to include the submission objects for each assignment.

Responses to requests made with a scoped access token only support this functionality when the 'Allow Include Parameters' option is also enabled. When this option is disabled, a request is made with a scoped token Canvas will ignore include and includes parameters.
Developer Key Scope Changes

During the lifetime of a developer key, scopes may be added or removed by account administrators. Below is a description of possible changes and how each will affect access tokens:

New scopes are added to a developer key

Access tokens issued prior to the addition of the new scope will continue to function. These access tokens will not, however, be usable with the new scope. To access the newly added resources clients should request a new access token with scopes. The requested scopes must be a subset of the scopes on the developer key.

Scopes are removed from a developer key

Access tokens issued prior to the removal of the scope(s) will not continue to function. Clients should request a new access token with scopes. The requested scopes must be a subset of the scopes on the developer key.

An unscoped developer key becomes scoped

Access tokens issued prior to the change will not continue to function. Clients should request a new access token with scopes. The requested scopes must be a subset of the scopes on the developer key.

If the client attempts to request a new access token without specifying scopes Canvas will respond with an error.

For details on unscoped vs scoped developer key see Developer Key Scopes above.

A scoped developer key becomes unscoped

Access tokens issued prior to the change will continue to function and have access to all resources of the authorizing user. Clients may continue to request scoped access tokens, but these tokens will be functional for all resources available to the authorizing user.

For details on unscoped vs scoped developer key see Developer Key Scopes above.

Account Calendars

Welcome to Our New API Docs! This is the new home for all things API (previously at Canvas LMS REST API Documentation).
Account Calendars API

API for viewing and toggling settings of account calendars.

An account calendar is available for each account in Canvas. All account calendars are hidden by default, but administrators with the manage_account_calendar_visibility permission may set calendars as visible. Administrators with the manage_account_calendar_events permission can create events in visible account calendars, and users associated with an account can add the calendar and see its events (if the calendar is visible). Events on calendars set as auto_subscribe calendars will appear on users' calendars even if they do not manually add it.

An AccountCalendar object looks like:

{
  // the ID of the account associated with this calendar
  "id": 204,
  // the name of the account associated with this calendar
  "name": "Department of Chemistry",
  // the account's parent ID, or null if this is the root account
  "parent_account_id": 1,
  // the ID of the root account, or null if this is the root account
  "root_account_id": 1,
  // whether this calendar is visible to users
  "visible": true,
  // whether users see this calendar's events without needing to manually add it
  "auto_subscribe": false,
  // number of this account's direct sub-accounts
  "sub_account_count": 0,
  // Asset string of the account
  "asset_string": "account_4",
  // Object type
  "type": "account",
  // url to get full detailed events

  "id": 2,
  // The display name of the account
  "name": "Canvas Account",
  // The UUID of the account
  "uuid": "WvAHhY5FINzq5IyRIJybGeiXyFkG3SqHUPb7jZY5",
  // The account's parent ID, or null if this is the root account
  "parent_account_id": 1,
  // The ID of the root account, or null if this is the root account
  "root_account_id": 1,
  // The state of the account. Can be 'active' or 'deleted'.
  "workflow_state": "active"
}

Get account

Lti::AccountLookupController#show

GET /api/lti/accounts/:account_id

Scope: url:GET|/api/lti/accounts/:account_id

Analytics

Welcome to Our New API Docs! This is the new home for all things API (previously at Canvas LMS REST API Documentation).
Analytics API

API for retrieving the data exposed in Canvas Analytics
Get department-level participation data

GET /api/v1/accounts/:account_id/analytics/terms/:term_id/activity

Scope: url:GET|/api/v1/accounts/:account_id/analytics/terms/:term_id/activity

GET /api/v1/accounts/:account_id/analytics/current/activity

Scope: url:GET|/api/v1/accounts/:account_id/analytics/current/activity

GET /api/v1/accounts/:account_id/analytics/completed/activity

Scope: url:GET|/api/v1/accounts/:account_id/analytics/completed/activity

Returns page view hits summed across all courses in the department. Two groupings of these counts are returned; one by day (by_date), the other by category (by_category). The possible categories are announcements, assignments, collaborations, conferences, discussions, files, general, grades, groups, modules, other, pages, and quizzes.

This and the other department-level endpoints have three variations which all return the same style of data but for different subsets of courses. All share the prefix /api/v1/accounts/<account_id>/analytics. The possible suffixes are:

* /current: includes all available courses in the default term
* /completed: includes all concluded courses in the default term
* /terms/<term_id>: includes all available or concluded courses in the
  given term.

Courses not yet offered or which have been deleted are never included.

/current and /completed are intended for use when the account has only one term. /terms/<term_id> is intended for use when the account has multiple terms.

The action follows the suffix.

Example Request:

curl https://<canvas>/api/v1/accounts/<account_id>/analytics/current/activity \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'

curl https://<canvas>/api/v1/accounts/<account_id>/analytics/completed/activity \

GET /api/v1/accounts/:account_id/analytics/completed/grades

Scope: url:GET|/api/v1/accounts/:account_id/analytics/completed/grades

Returns the distribution of grades for students in courses in the department. Each data point is one student’s current grade in one course; if a student is in multiple courses, he contributes one value per course, but if he’s enrolled multiple times in the same course (e.g. a lecture section and a lab section), he only constributes on value for that course.

Grades are binned to the nearest integer score; anomalous grades outside the 0 to 100 range are ignored. The raw counts are returned, not yet normalized by the total count.

Shares the same variations on endpoint as the participation data.

Announcement External Feeds

Welcome to Our New API Docs! This is the new home for all things API (previously at Canvas LMS REST API Documentation).
Announcement External Feeds API

External feeds represent RSS feeds that can be attached to a Course or Group, in order to automatically create announcements for each new item in the feed.

An ExternalFeed object looks like:

{
  // The ID of the feed
  "id": 5,
  // The title of the feed, pulled from the feed itself. If the feed hasn't yet
  // been pulled, a temporary name will be synthesized based on the URL
  "display_name": "My Blog",
  // The HTTP/HTTPS URL to the feed
  "url": "http://example.com/myblog.rss",
  // If not null, only feed entries whose title contains this string will trigger
  // new posts in Canvas
  "header_match": "pattern",
  // When this external feed was added to Canvas
  "created_at": "2012-06-01T00:00:00-06:00",
  // The verbosity setting determines how much of the feed's content is imported
  // into Canvas as part of the posting. 'link_only' means that only the title and
  // a link to the item. 'truncate' means that a summary of the first portion of
  // the item body will be used. 'full' means that the full item body will be
  // used.
  "verbosity": "truncate"

PUT /api/v1/courses/:course_id/assignments/bulk_update

Scope: url:PUT|/api/v1/courses/:course_id/assignments/bulk_update

Update due dates and availability dates for multiple assignments in a course.

Accepts a JSON array of objects containing two keys each: id, the assignment id, and all_dates, an array of AssignmentDate structures containing the base and/or override dates for the assignment, as returned from the List assignments endpoint with include[]=all_dates.

This endpoint cannot create or destroy assignment overrides; any existing assignment overrides that are not referenced in the arguments will be left alone. If an override is given, any dates that are not supplied with it will be defaulted. To clear a date, specify null explicitly.

All referenced assignments will be validated before any are saved. A list of errors will be returned if any provided dates are invalid, and no changes will be saved.

The bulk update is performed in a background job, use the Progress API to check its status.

Appendixes
Appendix: Group assignments

The following diagram provides an example to describe the structure of group assignments. It also shows the correspondence between the fields of an assignment override API request and the resources they map to.
Group assignments structure example

The components in yellow are group sets. When creating or updating an assignment override, you will refer to the group set by the group_category_id field.

The components in green are groups. An assignment can become a group assignment iff it has a group_category_id that maps to an active group set, as well as a group_id that maps to an active, valid group. In the API, you will be specifying the group by the group_id field of the assignment_override construct.

Important: an assignment must be assigned to a group set (the group_category_id field) on creation for an override with a group_id to be effective.

Authentication Providers

Welcome to Our New API Docs! This is the new home for all things API (previously at Canvas LMS REST API Documentation).
Authentication Providers API

An AuthenticationProvider object looks like:

  "federated_attributes": null,
  // If multi-factor authentication is required when logging in with this
  // authentication provider. The account must not have MFA disabled.
  "mfa_required": null
}

A SSOSettings object looks like:

// Settings that are applicable across an account's authentication
// configuration, even if there are multiple individual providers
{
  // The label used for unique login identifiers.
  "login_handle_name": "Username",

}

A FederatedAttributesConfig object looks like:

// A mapping of Canvas attribute names to attribute names that a provider may
// send, in order to update the value of these attributes when a user logs in.
// The values can be a FederatedAttributeConfig, or a raw string corresponding
// to the "attribute" property of a FederatedAttributeConfig. In responses, full
// FederatedAttributeConfig objects are returned if JIT provisioning is enabled,
// otherwise just the attribute names are returned.
{
  // A comma separated list of role names to grant to the user. Note that these

Scope: url:POST|/api/v1/groups/:group_id/content_migrations

POST /api/v1/users/:user_id/content_migrations

Scope: url:POST|/api/v1/users/:user_id/content_migrations

Create a content migration. If the migration requires a file to be uploaded the actual processing of the file will start once the file upload process is completed. File uploading works as described in the File Upload Documentation except that the values are set on a pre_attachment sub-hash.

For migrations that don’t require a file to be uploaded, like course copy, the processing will begin as soon as the migration is created.

You can use the Progress API to track the progress of the migration. The migration’s progress is linked to with the progress_url value.

The two general workflows are:

If no file upload is needed:

    POST to create

    Use the Progress specified in progress_url to monitor progress

For file uploading:

    POST to create with file info in pre_attachment

    Do file upload processing using the data in the pre_attachment data

    GET the ContentMigration

    Use the Progress specified in progress_url to monitor progress

(required if doing .zip file upload)

Request Parameters:
Parameter

Description

migration_type

Required string

The type of the migration. Use the Migrator endpoint to see all available migrators. Default allowed values: canvas_cartridge_importer, common_cartridge_importer, course_copy_importer, zip_file_importer, qti_converter, moodle_converter

pre_attachment[name]

string

Required if uploading a file. This is the first step in uploading a file to the content migration. See the File Upload Documentation for details on the file upload workflow.

string

Other file upload properties, See File Upload Documentation

settings[file_url]

string

A URL to download the file from. Must not require authentication.

settings[content_export_id]

string

The id of a ContentExport to import. This allows you to import content previously exported from Canvas without needing to download and re-upload it.

settings[source_course_id]

string

The course to copy from for a course copy migration. (required if doing course copy)

settings[folder_id]

string

The folder to unzip the .zip file into for a zip_file_import.

boolean

Whether to overwrite quizzes with the same identifiers between content packages.

settings[question_bank_id]

integer

The existing question bank ID to import questions into if not specified in the content package.

settings[question_bank_name]

string

The question bank to import questions into if not specified in the content package, if both bank id and name are set, id will take precedence.

settings[insert_into_module_id]

integer

The id of a module in the target course. This will add all imported items (that can be added to a module) to the given module.

settings[insert_into_module_type]

string

If provided (and insert_into_module_id is supplied), only add objects of the specified type to the module.

Allowed values: assignment, discussion_topic, file, page, quiz

settings[insert_into_module_position]

integer

The (1-based) position to insert the imported items into the course (if insert_into_module_id is supplied). If this parameter is omitted, items will be added to the end of the module.

The id of an assignment group in the target course. If provided, all imported assignments will be moved to the given assignment group.

settings[importer_skips]

Array

Set of importers to skip, even if otherwise selected by migration settings.

Allowed values: all_course_settings, visibility_settings

settings[import_blueprint_settings]

boolean

Import the “use as blueprint course” setting as well as the list of locked items from the source course or package. The destination course must not be associated with an existing blueprint course and cannot have any student or observer enrollments.

date_shift_options[shift_dates]

boolean

Whether to shift dates in the copied course

date_shift_options[old_start_date]

Date

The original start date of the source content/course

date_shift_options[old_end_date]

date_shift_options[remove_dates]

boolean

Whether to remove dates in the copied course. Cannot be used in conjunction with shift_dates.

selective_import

boolean

If set, perform a selective import instead of importing all content. The migration will identify the contents of the package and then stop in the waiting_for_select workflow state. At this point, use the List items endpoint to enumerate the contents of the package, identifying the copy parameters for the desired content. Then call the Update endpoint and provide these copy parameters to start the import.

select

Hash

For course_copy_importer migrations, this parameter allows you to select the objects to copy without using the selective_import argument and waiting_for_select state as is required for uploaded imports (though that workflow is also supported for course copy migrations). The keys are object types like ‘files’, ‘folders’, ‘pages’, etc. The value for each key is a list of object ids. An id can be an integer or a string. Multiple object types can be selected in the same call.

Allowed values: folders, files, attachments, quizzes, assignments, announcements, calendar_events, discussion_topics, modules, module_items, pages, rubrics

However, changing most settings after the migration process has started will not do anything. Generally updating the content migration will be used when there is a file upload problem, or when importing content selectively. If the first upload has a problem you can supply new pre_attachment values to start the process again.

Returns a ContentMigration object.

GET /api/v1/users/:user_id/content_migrations/:id/selective_data

Scope: url:GET|/api/v1/users/:user_id/content_migrations/:id/selective_data

Enumerates the content available for selective import in a tree structure. Each node provides a property copy argument that can be supplied to the Update endpoint to selectively copy the content associated with that tree node and its children. Each node may also provide a sub_items_url or an array of sub_items which you can use to obtain copy parameters for a subset of the resources in a given node.

If no type is sent you will get a list of the top-level sections in the content. It will look something like this:

[{
  "type": "course_settings",
  "property": "copy[all_course_settings]",
  "title": "Course Settings"
},
{
  "type": "context_modules",
  "property": "copy[all_context_modules]",
  "title": "Modules",
  "count": 5,
  "sub_items_url": "http://example.com/api/v1/courses/22/content_migrations/77/selective_data?type=context_modules"
},
{
  "type": "assignments",
  "property": "copy[all_assignments]",
  "title": "Assignments",
  "count": 2,
  "sub_items_url": "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/courses/22/content_migrations/77/selective_data?type=assignments"
}]

When a type is provided, nodes may be further divided via sub_items. For example, using type=assignments results in a node for each assignment group and a sub_item for each assignment, like this:

[{
  "type": "assignment_groups",
  "title": "An Assignment Group",
  "property": "copy[assignment_groups][id_i855cf145e5acc7435e1bf1c6e2126e5f]",
  "sub_items": [{
      "type": "assignments",
      "title": "Assignment 1",
      "property": "copy[assignments][id_i2102a7fa93b29226774949298626719d]"
  }, {
      "type": "assignments",
      "title": "Assignment 2",
      "property": "copy[assignments][id_i310cba275dc3f4aa8a3306bbbe380979]"
  }]
}]

To import the items corresponding to a particular tree node, use the property as a parameter to the Update endpoint and assign a value of 1, for example:

copy[assignments][id_i310cba275dc3f4aa8a3306bbbe380979]=1

You can include multiple copy parameters to selectively import multiple items or groups of items.

Request Parameters:
Parameter

Description

type

string

The type of content to enumerate.

Allowed values: context_modules, assignments, quizzes, assessment_question_banks, discussion_topics, wiki_pages, context_external_tools, tool_profiles, announcements, calendar_events, rubrics, groups, learning_outcomes, attachments
Get asset id mapping

GET /api/v1/courses/:course_id/content_migrations/:id/asset_id_mapping

Scope: url:GET|/api/v1/courses/:course_id/content_migrations/:id/asset_id_mapping

Given a complete course copy or blueprint import content migration, return a mapping of asset ids from the source course to the destination course that were copied in this migration or an earlier one with the same course pair and migration_type (course copy or blueprint).

The returned object’s keys are asset types as they appear in API URLs (announcements, assignments, discussion_topics, files, module_items, modules, pages, and quizzes). The values are a mapping from id in source course to id in destination course for objects of this type.

Example Request:

curl https://<canvas>/api/v1/courses/<course_id>/content_migrations/<id>/asset_id_mapping \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'

Example Response:

{
  "assignments": {"13": "740", "14": "741"},
  "discussion_topics": {"15": "743", "16": "744"}

  // user selects to show or hide notes
  "teacher_notes": false,
  // header text
  "title": "Stuff",
  // column order
  "position": 1,
  // won't be displayed if hidden is true
  "hidden": false,
  // won't be editable in the gradebook UI
  "read_only": true
}

A ColumnDatum object looks like:

// ColumnDatum objects contain the entry for a column for each user.
{
  "content": "Nut allergy",

Get the full topic

DiscussionTopicsApiController#view

GET /api/v1/courses/:course_id/discussion_topics/:topic_id/view

Scope: url:GET|/api/v1/courses/:course_id/discussion_topics/:topic_id/view

GET /api/v1/groups/:group_id/discussion_topics/:topic_id/view

Scope: url:GET|/api/v1/groups/:group_id/discussion_topics/:topic_id/view

Return a cached structure of the discussion topic, containing all entries, their authors, and their message bodies.

May require (depending on the topic) that the user has posted in the topic. If it is required, and the user has not posted, will respond with a 403 Forbidden status and the body ‘require_initial_post’.

In some rare situations, this cached structure may not be available yet. In that case, the server will respond with a 503 error, and the caller should try again soon.

The response is an object containing the following keys:

    “participants”: A list of summary information on users who have posted to the discussion. Each value is an object containing their id, display_name, and avatar_url.

    “unread_entries”: A list of entry ids that are unread by the current user. this implies that any entry not in this list is read.

    “entry_ratings”: A map of entry ids to ratings by the current user. Entries not in this list have no rating. Only populated if rating is enabled.

    “forced_entries”: A list of entry ids that have forced_read_state set to true. This flag is meant to indicate the entry’s read_state has been manually set to ‘unread’ by the user, so the entry should not be automatically marked as read.

    “view”: A threaded view of all the entries in the discussion, containing the id, user_id, and message.

    “new_entries”: Because this view is eventually consistent, it’s possible that newly created or updated entries won’t yet be reflected in the view. If the application wants to also get a flat list of all entries not yet reflected in the view, pass include_new_entries=1 to the request and this array of entries will be returned. These entries are returned in a flat array, in ascending created_at order.

Example Request:

curl 'https://<canvas>/api/v1/courses/<course_id>/discussion_topics/<topic_id>/view' \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

Example Response:

EnrollmentsApiController#index

GET /api/v1/courses/:course_id/enrollments

Scope: url:GET|/api/v1/courses/:course_id/enrollments

GET /api/v1/sections/:section_id/enrollments

Scope: url:GET|/api/v1/sections/:section_id/enrollments

GET /api/v1/users/:user_id/enrollments

Scope: url:GET|/api/v1/users/:user_id/enrollments

Depending on the URL given, return a paginated list of either (1) all of the enrollments in a course, (2) all of the enrollments in a section or (3) all of a user’s enrollments. This includes student, teacher, TA, and observer enrollments.

If a user has multiple enrollments in a context (e.g. as a teacher and a student or in multiple course sections), each enrollment will be listed separately.

note: Currently, only a root level admin user can return other users’ enrollments. A user can, however, return his/her own enrollments.

Enrollments scoped to a course context will include inactive states by default if the caller has account admin authorization and the state[] parameter is omitted.

Request Parameters:
Parameter
Type
Description

type[]

string

A list of enrollment types to return. Accepted values are ‘StudentEnrollment’, ‘TeacherEnrollment’, ‘TaEnrollment’, ‘DesignerEnrollment’, and ‘ObserverEnrollment.’ If omitted, all enrollment types are returned. This argument is ignored if ‘role` is given.

role[]

string

A list of enrollment roles to return. Accepted values include course-level roles created by the Add Role API as well as the base enrollment types accepted by the ‘type` argument above.

state[]

string

Filter by enrollment state. If omitted, ‘active’ and ‘invited’ enrollments are returned. The following synthetic states are supported only when querying a user’s enrollments (either via user_id argument or via user enrollments endpoint): current_and_invited, current_and_future, current_future_and_restricted, current_and_concluded

Allowed values: active, invited, creation_pending, deleted, rejected, completed, inactive, current_and_invited, current_and_future, current_future_and_restricted, current_and_concluded

include[]

string

Array of additional information to include on the enrollment or user records. “avatar_url” and “group_ids” will be returned on the user record. If “current_points” is specified, the fields “current_points” and (if the caller has permissions to manage grades) “unposted_current_points” will be included in the “grades” hash for student enrollments.

Allowed values: avatar_url, group_ids, locked, observed_users, can_be_removed, uuid, current_points

user_id

string

Filter by user_id (only valid for course or section enrollment queries). If set to the current user’s id, this is a way to determine if the user has any enrollments in the course or section, independent of whether the user has permission to view other people on the roster.

grading_period_id

integer

Return grades for the given grading_period. If this parameter is not specified, the returned grades will be for the whole course.

enrollment_term_id

integer

Returns only enrollments for the specified enrollment term. This parameter only applies to the user enrollments path. May pass the ID from the enrollment terms api or the SIS id prepended with ‘sis_term_id:’.

sis_account_id[]

string

Returns only enrollments for the specified SIS account ID(s). Does not look into sub_accounts. May pass in array or string.

sis_course_id[]

string

Returns only enrollments matching the specified SIS course ID(s). May pass in array or string.

sis_section_id[]

string

Returns only section enrollments matching the specified SIS section ID(s). May pass in array or string.

sis_user_id[]

string

Returns only enrollments for the specified SIS user ID(s). May pass in array or string.

created_for_sis_id[]

boolean

If sis_user_id is present and created_for_sis_id is true, Returns only enrollments for the specified SIS ID(s). If a user has two sis_id’s, one enrollment may be created using one of the two ids. This would limit the enrollments returned from the endpoint to enrollments that were created from a sis_import with that sis_user_id

Returns a list of Enrollment objects.
Enrollment by ID

Feature Flags

Welcome to Our New API Docs! This is the new home for all things API (previously at Canvas LMS REST API Documentation).
Feature Flags API

Manage optional features in Canvas.

Deprecated[2016-01-15] FeatureFlags previously had a locking_account_id field; it was never used, and has been removed. It is still included in API responses for backwards compatibility reasons. Its value is always null.

A Feature object looks like:

{
  // The symbolic name of the feature, used in FeatureFlags
  "feature": "fancy_wickets",
  // The user-visible name of the feature
  "display_name": "Fancy Wickets",
  // The type of object the feature applies to (RootAccount, Account, Course, or
  // User):
  // * RootAccount features may only be controlled by flags on root accounts.
  // * Account features may be controlled by flags on accounts and their parent
  // accounts.
  // * Course features may be controlled by flags on courses and their parent
  // accounts.
  // * User features may be controlled by flags on users and site admin only.
  "applies_to": "Course",
  // The FeatureFlag that applies to the caller
  "feature_flag": {"feature":"fancy_wickets","state":"allowed"},
  // If true, a feature that is 'allowed' globally will be 'off' by default in
  // root accounts. Otherwise, root accounts inherit the global 'allowed' setting,
  // which allows sub-accounts and courses to turn features on with no root
  // account action.
  "root_opt_in": true,
  // Whether the feature is a feature preview. If true, opting in includes ongoing
  // updates outside the regular release schedule.
  "beta": true,
  // Whether the details of the feature are autoexpanded on page load vs. the user
  // clicking to expand.
  "autoexpand": true,
  // A URL to the release notes describing the feature
  "release_notes_url": "http://canvas.example.com/release_notes#fancy_wickets"
}

A FeatureFlag object looks like:

{
  // The type of object to which this flag applies (Account, Course, or User).
  // (This field is not present if this FeatureFlag represents the global Canvas
  // default)
  "context_type": "Account",
  // The id of the object to which this flag applies (This field is not present if
  // this FeatureFlag represents the global Canvas default)
  "context_id": 1038,
  // The feature this flag controls
  "feature": "fancy_wickets",
  // The policy for the feature at this context.  can be 'off', 'allowed',
  // 'allowed_on', or 'on'.
  "state": "allowed",
  // If set, this feature flag cannot be changed in the caller's context because
  // the flag is set 'off' or 'on' in a higher context
  "locked": false
}

Scope: url:DELETE|/api/v1/users/:user_id/features/flags/:feature

Remove feature flag for a given Account, Course, or User. (Note that the flag must be defined on the Account, Course, or User directly.) The object will then inherit the feature flags from a higher account, if any exist. If this flag was ‘on’ or ‘off’, then lower-level account flags that were masked by this one will apply again.

Example Request:

curl -X DELETE 'http://<canvas>/api/v1/courses/1/features/flags/fancy_wickets' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

Returns a FeatureFlag object.

Welcome to Our New API Docs! This is the new home for all things API (previously at Canvas LMS REST API Documentation).
Grade Change Log API

Query audit log of grade change events.

For each endpoint, a compound document is returned. The primary collection of event objects is paginated, ordered by date descending. Secondary collections of assignments, courses, students and graders related to the returned events are also included. Refer to the Assignment, Courses, and Users APIs for descriptions of the objects in those collections.

A GradeChangeEventLinks object looks like:

{
  // ID of the assignment associated with the event
  "assignment": 2319,
  // ID of the course associated with the event. will match the context_id in the
  // associated assignment if the context type for the assignment is a course
  "course": 2319,
  // ID of the student associated with the event. will match the user_id in the
  // associated submission.
  "student": 2319,
  // ID of the grader associated with the event. will match the grader_id in the
  // associated submission.
  "grader": 2319,
  // ID of the page view during the event if it exists.
  "page_view": "e2b76430-27a5-0131-3ca1-48e0eb13f29b"
}

A GradeChangeEvent object looks like:

{
  // ID of the event.
  "id": "e2b76430-27a5-0131-3ca1-48e0eb13f29b",

Group Categories

Welcome to Our New API Docs! This is the new home for all things API (previously at Canvas LMS REST API Documentation).
Group Categories API

Group Categories allow grouping of groups together in canvas. There are a few different built-in group categories used, or custom ones can be created. The built in group categories are: "communities", "student_organized", and "imported".

A GroupCategory object looks like:

{
  // The ID of the group category.
  "id": 17,
  // The display name of the group category.
  "name": "Math Groups",
  // Certain types of group categories have special role designations. Currently,
  // these include: 'communities', 'student_organized', and 'imported'. Regular
  // course/account group categories have a role of null.
  "role": "communities",
  // If the group category allows users to join a group themselves, thought they
  // may only be a member of one group per group category at a time. Values
  // include 'restricted', 'enabled', and null 'enabled' allows students to assign
  // themselves to a group 'restricted' restricts them to only joining a group in
  // their section null disallows students from joining groups
  "self_signup": null,
  // Gives instructors the ability to automatically have group leaders assigned. 
  // Values include 'random', 'first', and null; 'random' picks a student from the
  // group at random as the leader, 'first' sets the first student to be assigned
  // to the group as the leader
  "auto_leader": null,
  // The course or account that the category group belongs to. The pattern here is
  // that whatever the context_type is, there will be an _id field named after
  // that type. So if instead context_type was 'Course', the course_id field would
  // be replaced by an course_id field.
  "context_type": "Account",
  "account_id": 3,
  // If self-signup is enabled, group_limit can be set to cap the number of users
  // in each group. If null, there is no limit.
  "group_limit": null,
  // The SIS identifier for the group category. This field is only included if the
  // user has permission to manage or view SIS information.
  "sis_group_category_id": null,
  // The unique identifier for the SIS import. This field is only included if the
  // user has permission to manage SIS information.
  "sis_import_id": null,
  // If the group category has not yet finished a randomly student assignment
  // request, a progress object will be attached, which will contain information
  // related to the progress of the assignment request. Refer to the Progress API
  // for more information
  "progress": null,
  // Indicates whether this group category is non-collaborative. A value of true
  // means these group categories rely on the manage_tags permissions and do not
  // have collaborative features
  "non_collaborative": null
}

Groups

Welcome to Our New API Docs! This is the new home for all things API (previously at Canvas LMS REST API Documentation).
Groups API

Groups serve as the data for a few different ideas in Canvas. The first is that they can be a community in the canvas network. The second is that they can be organized by students in a course, for study or communication (but not grading). The third is that they can be organized by teachers or account administrators for the purpose of projects, assignments, and grading. This last kind of group is always part of a group category, which adds the restriction that a user may only be a member of one group per category.

All of these types of groups function similarly, and can be the parent context for many other types of functionality and interaction, such as collections, discussions, wikis, and shared files.

Group memberships are the objects that tie users and groups together.

A Group object looks like:

{
  // The ID of the group.
  "id": 17,
  // The display name of the group.
  "name": "Math Group 1",
  // A description of the group. This is plain text.
  "description": null,
  // Whether or not the group is public.  Currently only community groups can be
  // made public.  Also, once a group has been set to public, it cannot be changed
  // back to private.
  "is_public": false,
  // Whether or not the current user is following this group.
  "followed_by_user": false,
  // How people are allowed to join the group.  For all groups except for
  // community groups, the user must share the group's parent course or account. 
  // For student organized or community groups, where a user can be a member of as
  // many or few as they want, the applicable levels are
  // 'parent_context_auto_join', 'parent_context_request', and 'invitation_only'. 
  // For class groups, where students are divided up and should only be part of
  // one group of the category, this value will always be 'invitation_only', and
  // is not relevant. * If 'parent_context_auto_join', anyone can join and will be
  // automatically accepted. * If 'parent_context_request', anyone  can request to
  // join, which must be approved by a group moderator. * If 'invitation_only',
  // only those how have received an invitation my join the group, by accepting
  // that invitation.
  "join_level": "invitation_only",
  // The number of members currently in the group
  "members_count": 0,
  // The url of the group's avatar
  "avatar_url": "https://<canvas>/files/avatar_image.png",
  // The course or account that the group belongs to. The pattern here is that
  // whatever the context_type is, there will be an _id field named after that
  // type. So if instead context_type was 'account', the course_id field would be
  // replaced by an account_id field.
  "context_type": "Course",
  // The course or account name that the group belongs to.
  "context_name": "Course 101",
  "course_id": 3,
  // Certain types of groups have special role designations. Currently, these
  // include: 'communities', 'student_organized', and 'imported'. Regular
  // course/account groups have a role of null.
  "role": null,
  // The ID of the group's category.
  "group_category_id": 4,
  // The SIS ID of the group. Only included if the user has permission to view SIS
  // information.
  "sis_group_id": "group4a",
  // The id of the SIS import if created through SIS. Only included if the user
  // has permission to manage SIS information.
  "sis_import_id": 14,
  // the storage quota for the group, in megabytes
  "storage_quota_mb": 50,
  // optional: the permissions the user has for the group. returned only for a
  // single group and include[]=permissions
  "permissions": {"create_discussion_topic":true,"create_announcement":true},
  // optional: A list of users that are members in the group. Returned only if
  // include[]=users. WARNING: this collection's size is capped (if there are an
  // extremely large number of users in the group (thousands) not all of them will
  // be returned).  If you need to capture all the users in a group with certainty
  // consider using the paginated /api/v1/groups/<group_id>/memberships endpoint.
  "users": null,
  // Indicates whether this group category is non-collaborative. A value of true
  // means these group categories rely on the manage_tags permissions and do not
  // have collaborative features
  "non_collaborative": null
}

A GroupMembership object looks like:

{
  // The id of the membership object
  "id": 92,
  // The id of the group object to which the membership belongs
  "group_id": 17,
  // The id of the user object to which the membership belongs
  "user_id": 3,
  // The current state of the membership. Current possible values are 'accepted',
  // 'invited', and 'requested'
  "workflow_state": "accepted",
  // Whether or not the user is a moderator of the group (the must also be an
  // active member of the group to moderate)
  "moderator": true,
  // optional: whether or not the record was just created on a create call (POST),
  // i.e. was the user just added to the group, or was the user already a member
  "just_created": true,
  // The id of the SIS import if created through SIS. Only included if the user
  // has permission to manage SIS information.
  "sis_import_id": 4
}

A LearningObjectDates object looks like:

{
  // the ID of the learning object (not present for checkpoints)
  "id": 4,
  // the due date for the learning object. returns null if not present or
  // applicable. never applicable for ungraded discussions, pages, and files
  "due_at": "2012-07-01T23:59:00-06:00",
  // the lock date (learning object is locked after this date). returns null if
  // not present
  "lock_at": "2012-07-01T23:59:00-06:00",
  // the reply_to_topic sub_assignment due_date. returns null if not present
  "reply_to_topic_due_at": "2012-07-01T23:59:00-06:00",
  // the reply_to_entry sub_assignment due_date. returns null if not present
  "required_replies_due_at": "2012-07-01T23:59:00-06:00",

user[trusted_account]

string

The domain of the account to search for the user. This field is required when identifying a user in a trusted account. This parameter is not available in OSS Canvas.

Example Request:

#create a facebook login for user with ID 123
curl 'https://<canvas>/api/v1/accounts/<account_id>/logins' \
     -F 'user[id]=123' \
     -F 'login[unique_id]=112233445566' \
     -F 'login[authentication_provider_id]=facebook' \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'

#create a login for user in another trusted account:
curl 'https://<canvas>/api/v1/accounts/<account_id>/logins' \
     -F 'user[existing_user_sis_id]=SIS42' \
     -F 'user[trusted_account]=canvas.example.edu' \

LTI Registrations

Welcome to Our New API Docs! This is the new home for all things API (previously at Canvas LMS REST API Documentation).
LTI Registrations API

BETA: This API resource is not finalized, and there could be breaking changes before its final release.

API for accessing and configuring LTI registrations in a root account. LTI Registrations can be any of:

    1.3 Dynamic Registration

    1.3 manual installation (via JSON, URL, or UI)

    1.1 manual installation (via XML, URL, or UI)

The Dynamic Registration process uses a different API endpoint to finalize the process and create the registration. The Registration guide has more details on that process.

A Lti::Registration object looks like:

// A registration of an LTI tool in Canvas
{
  // the Canvas ID of the Lti::Registration object
  "id": 2,
  // Tool-provided registration name
  "name": "My LTI Tool",
  // Admin-configured friendly display name
  "admin_nickname": "My LTI Tool (Campus A)",
  // Tool-provided URL to the tool's icon

  // Site Admin
  "inherited": false,
  // LTI version of the registration, either 1.1 or 1.3
  "lti_version": "1.3",
  // Flag indicating if registration was created using LTI Dynamic Registration.

LTI Resource Links

Welcome to Our New API Docs! This is the new home for all things API (previously at Canvas LMS REST API Documentation).
LTI Resource Links API

API that exposes LTI Resource Links for viewing and editing. LTI Resource Links are artifacts created by the LTI 1.3 Deep Linking process, where a user selects a content item that is returned to Canvas for future launches.

Resource Links can be associated with Assignments, Module Items, Collaborations, and Rich Content embeddings.

Use of this API requires the manage_lti_add and manage_assignments_add permissions.

Caution! Resource Links are usually managed by the tool that created them via LTI Deep Linking, and using this API to create or modify links may result in errors when launching the link.

Common patterns for using this API include:

    facilitating migration between two different versions of the same tool by updating the domain of the launch URL

    creating new links to embed in rich content in Canvas

    responding to a course copy or other Canvas content migration by updating the launch URL

A Lti::ResourceLink object looks like:

{
  // The Canvas identifier for the LTI Resource Link.
  "id": 1,
  // The Canvas identifier for the context that the LTI Resource Link is
  // associated with.
  "context_id": 1,
  // The type of the context that the LTI Resource Link is associated with.
  "context_type": "Course",
  // The Canvas identifier for the LTI 1.3 External Tool that the LTI Resource
  // Link was originally installed from. Note that this tool may have been deleted
  // or reinstalled and may not be the tool that would be launched for this url.
  "context_external_tool_id": 1,
  // The type of Canvas content for the resource link. Included for convenience.
  "resource_type": "assignment",
  // The Canvas URL that launches the LTI Resource Link. Suitable for use in
  // Canvas rich content
  "canvas_launch_url": "https://example.instructure.com/courses/1/external_tools/retrieve?resource_link_lookup_uuid=ae43ba23-d238-49bc-ab55-ba7f79f77896",
  // The LTI identifier for the LTI Resource Link, included as the
  // resource_link_id when this link is launched
  "resource_link_uuid": "ae43ba23-d238-49bc-ab55-ba7f79f77896",
  // A unique identifier for the LTI Resource Link, present in the rich content
  // representation. Remains the same across content migration.
  "lookup_uuid": "c522554a-d4be-49ef-b163-9c87fdc6ad6f",
  // The title of the LTI Resource Link. Usually tool-provided, or matches the
  // assignment name
  "title": "Assignment 1",
  // The tool URL to which the LTI Resource Link will launch
  "url": "https://example.com/lti/launch/content_item/123",
  // The LTI 1.1 identifier for the LTI Resource Link, included in lti1p1
  // migration claim when launched. Only present if tool was migrated from 1.1 to
  // 1.3.
  "lti_1_1_id": "6a8aaca162bfc4393804afd4cd53cd94413c48bb",
  // Timestamp of the resource link's creation
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  // Timestamp of the resource link's last update
  "updated_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  // The state of the resource link
  "workflow_state": "active",
  // Type of the associated content this resource link belongs to if present. Now
  // only supports `ModuleItems`, later may be extend others
  "associated_content_type": "ModuleItem",
  // The Canvas identifier of the associated content, e.g. ModuleItem related to
  // this link. Present if associated_content_type is present
  "associated_content_id": 1
}

Provisional grades are created by using the Submissions API endpoint "Grade or comment on a submission" with provisional=true. They can be viewed by using "List assignment submissions", "Get a single submission", or "List gradeable students" with include[]=provisional_grades. This API performs other operations on provisional grades for use with the Moderated Grading feature.

A ProvisionalGrade object looks like:

{
  // The identifier for the provisional grade
  "provisional_grade_id": 23,
  // The numeric score
  "score": 90,
  // The grade
  "grade": "A-",
  // Whether the grade was applied to the most current submission (false if the
  // student resubmitted after grading)

Modules

Welcome to Our New API Docs! This is the new home for all things API (previously at Canvas LMS REST API Documentation).
Modules API

Modules are collections of learning materials useful for organizing courses and optionally providing a linear flow through them. Module items can be accessed linearly or sequentially depending on module configuration. Items can be unlocked by various criteria such as reading a page or achieving a minimum score on a quiz. Modules themselves can be unlocked by the completion of other Modules.

If any active AssignmentOverrides exist on a ContextModule, then only students who have an applicable override can access the module and are assigned its items. AssignmentOverrides can be created for a (group of) student(s) or a section.

A Module object looks like:

{
  // the unique identifier for the module
  "id": 123,
  // the state of the module: 'active', 'deleted'
  "workflow_state": "active",
  // the position of this module in the course (1-based)
  "position": 2,
  // the name of this module
  "name": "Imaginary Numbers and You",
  // (Optional) the date this module will unlock
  "unlock_at": "2012-12-31T06:00:00-06:00",

New Quiz Items

Welcome to Our New API Docs! This is the new home for all things API (previously at Canvas LMS REST API Documentation).
New Quiz Items API

API for accessing and building items inside a New Quiz. To interact with the quiz itself, see the New Quizzes API.

Glossary:

Quiz Items can be among several types as described here. For now, all types can be retrieved (GET), but some types are restricted to only that functionality.

QuestionItem: question items are the various question types allowed for Quizzes. These question types can be created, updated, retrieved, and deleted with the API. See the Appendix for more details.

StimulusItem: stimulus items are quiz items that define a stimulus that can have associated questions attached to it. For now, stimulus items can only be retrieved with the API. They must be created and updated via the UI.

BankItem: bank items are quiz questions or other items that are part of an item bank. For now, bank items can only be retrieved with the API. They must be created and updated via the UI.

BankEntry: bank entry items allow for a random selection of items from an associated bank to be included in the quiz. For now, bank items can only be retrieved with the API. They must be created and updated via the UI.

A QuizItem object looks like:

// Individual items within a quiz, whether they're questions, stimuli, banked
// content, or question banks.
{
  // the ID of the quiz item
  "id": "35",
  // the position of the item within the quiz. The first item in a quiz is given
  // position 1.
  "position": 2,
  // the number of points available to score on this item
  "points_possible": 10.0,
  // the type of the item. One of 'Item', 'Stimulus', 'BankEntry', or 'Bank'.
  "entry_type": "Item",
  // whether the current user can edit the item -- used internally, no need to set
  "entry_editable": true,
  // the ID of the stimulus that this item is associated with. null if not
  // associated with any stimuli.
  "stimulus_quiz_entry_id": "3",
  // status of the item. one of 'mutable' or 'immutable'.  Used internally, no
  // need to set
  "status": "mutable",
  // additional properties for the item (currently only populated by items with a
  // BankItem entry)
  "properties": null,
  // the specific data associated with the quiz item.  These items can be either a
  // QuestionItem, StimulusItem, BankEntryItem, or BankItem, depending on
  // entry_type, and are defined
  // separately
  "entry": null
}

A QuestionItem object looks like:

{
  // the question title
  "title": "Linear Algebra 1-104",
  // the question content (can include html for rich content)

  // type of calculator the user will have access to during the question ('none',
  // basic' or 'scientific')
  "calculator_type": "none",
  // correct, incorrect, and general feedback for the question (see
  // QuestionFeedback)
  "feedback": null,
  // can be thought of as the question type. One of 'multi-answer', 'matching',
  // 'categorization',
  // 'file-upload', 'formula', 'ordering', 'rich-fill-blank', 'hot-spot',
  // 'choice', 'numeric', 'true-false',
  // 'essay', or 'fill-blank' (deprecated). See Appendix: Question Types for more
  // info about each type.

  // an object that contains additional properties for some question types. See
  // Appendix: Question Types for more info about this field.
  "properties": null,
  // describes how to score the question. See Appendix: Question Types for more
  // info about this field.
  "scoring_data": null,
  // feedback provided for each answer (rich content, only available on 'choice'
  // question types)
  "answer_feedback": {"5595b4c2-7dd6-447f-b8f1-9b6d0e0c287a":"\u003cp\u003eClose, but in this case...\u003c\/p\u003e"},
  // the algorithm used to score the question. See Appendix: Question Types for
  // more info about this field.
  "scoring_algorithm": "AllOrNothing"
}

A StimulusItem object looks like:

{
  // stimulus title
  "title": "Consider the following image",
  // stimulus content (rich content)
  "body": "<img src=... />",
  // additional stimulus instructions
  "instructions": "Some instructions...",
  // optional URL; not visible to students
  "source_url": "https://example.com",
  // where the stimulus appears relative to questions ('top' or 'left')
  "orientation": "left",
  // if the stimulus is treated as a passage (text - no question block)
  "passage": false
}

{
  // the type of the item. Either 'Item' or 'Stimulus'.
  "entry_type": "Item",
  // whether the banked item is archived
  "archived": false,
  // the item (either a QuestionItem or StimulusItem, depending on entry_type)
  "entry": null

  // the number of items in the bank, including stimuli
  "entry_count": 20,
  // the number of items in the bank, excluding stimuli
  "item_entry_count": 18
}

An ItemProperties object looks like:

{
  // for items with a BankItem entry - the number of items to randomly select from
  // the bank. null if all items should be included.
  "sample_num": 5
}

A QuestionFeedback object looks like:

{
  // general feedback to show regardless of answer (rich content)
  "neutral": "<p>That was a hard one.</p>",
  // feedback to show if the question is answered correctly (rich content)

Appendixes
Appendix: Question Types

The quiz items API retrieves and manages the quiz items associated with a quiz such as question types, stimulus items, and item bank entries. This supplemental data describes the specific quiz item data for question types.

Some data creation for quiz items must include UUID values. These UUIDs must be generated properly when creating question types that require them. An online generator, such as https://www.uuidgenerator.net/, can be used to generate one or more UUIDs. A Version 4 UUID is recommended.

A complete example of a JSON request body for a choice question type is provided below. More details about each of the 13 question types are provided afterwards.

Example request body for choice question:

Hot Spot

To create a hotspot question, first upload the image to the url obtained with the media_upload_url endpoint. Then create the question item, including the image's url in the item's interaction_data. The requests look like this:

    GET /api/quiz/v1/courses/:course_id/quizzes/:assignment_id/items/media_upload_url. This returns a presigned url for uploading the image.

    PUT <media_upload_url> with the image included in the request as a data attribute. For example, in cURL:

    curl --X PUT 'http://quiz.minio.docker/dev-uploads/item_media/1e6f97fc-f56c-4b29-96ac-08474b9bf969/6e5ad29e-119d-4a08-8504-daf088928612?X-Amz-Signature=2c8f37219...' \
    --header 'Content-Type: image/png' \
    --data '@/Documents/"panda".png'

    POST /api/quiz/v1/courses/:course_id/quizzes/:assignment_id/items, including the unsigned media_upload_url in the request's interaction_data param, like this:

    {
       "interaction_data": {
           // note: the query params present on the signed url are not included here
           "image_url": "http://quiz.minio.docker/dev-uploads/item_media/1e6f97fc-f56c-4b29-96ac-08474b9bf969/6e5ad29e-119d-4a08-8504-daf088928612"

Originality Reports

Welcome to Our New API Docs! This is the new home for all things API (previously at Canvas LMS REST API Documentation).
Originality Reports API

LTI API for OriginalityReports (Must use JWT access tokens with this API).

Originality reports may be used by external tools providing plagiarism detection services to give an originality score to an assignment submission's file. An originality report has an associated file ID (the file submitted by the student) and an originality score between 0 and 100.

Note that when creating or updating an originality report a tool_setting[resource_type_code] may be specified as part of the originality report. This parameter should be used if the tool provider wishes to display originality reports as LTI launches.

The value of tool_setting[resource_type_code] should be a resource_handler's "resource_type" code. Canvas will lookup the resource handler specified and do a launch to the message with the type "basic-lti-launch-request" using its "path". If the optional tool_setting[resource_url] parameter is provided, Canvas will use this URL instead of the message's path but will still send all the parameters specified by the message. When using the tool_setting[resource_url] the tool_setting[resource_type_code] must also be specified.

A ToolSetting object looks like:

{
  // the resource type code of the resource handler to use to display originality
  // reports
  "resource_type_code": "originality_reports",
  // a URL that may be used to override the launch URL inferred by the specified
  // resource_type_code. If used a 'resource_type_code' must also be specified.
  "resource_url": "http://www.test.com/originality_report"
}

An OriginalityReport object looks like:

{
  // The id of the OriginalityReport
  "id": 4,
  // The id of the file receiving the originality score
  "file_id": 8,
  // A number between 0 and 100 representing the originality score
  "originality_score": 0.16,
  // The ID of the file within Canvas containing the originality report document
  // (if provided)
  "originality_report_file_id": 23,
  // A non-LTI launch URL where the originality score of the file may be found.
  "originality_report_url": "http://www.example.com/report",
  // A ToolSetting object containing optional 'resource_type_code' and
  // 'resource_url'
  "tool_setting": null,
  // A message describing the error. If set, the workflow_state will become
  // 'error.'
  "error_report": null,
  // The submitted_at date time of the submission.
  "submission_time": null,
  // The id of the root Account associated with the OriginalityReport
  "root_account_id": 1
}

originality_report[tool_setting][resource_url]

string

The URL Canvas should launch to when showing an LTI originality report. Note that this value is inferred from the specified resource handler’s message “path” value (See ‘resource_type_code) unless it is specified. If this parameter is used a resource_type_code` must also be specified.

originality_report[workflow_state]

string

May be set to “pending”, “error”, or “scored”. If an originality score is provided a workflow state of “scored” will be inferred.

originality_report[error_message]

string

A message describing the error. If set, the “workflow_state” will be set to “error.”

originality_report[attempt]

integer

If no ‘file_idis given, and no file is required for the assignment (that is, the assignment allows an online text entry), this parameter may be given to clarify which attempt number the report is for (in the case of resubmissions). If this field is omitted and nofile_id` is given, the report will be created (or updated, if it exists) for the first submission attempt with no associated file.

Outcome Groups

Welcome to Our New API Docs! This is the new home for all things API (previously at Canvas LMS REST API Documentation).
Outcome Groups API

API for accessing learning outcome group information.

Learning outcome groups organize outcomes within a context (or in the global "context" for global outcomes). Every outcome is created in a particular context (that context then becomes its "owning context") but may be linked multiple times in one or more related contexts. This allows different accounts or courses to organize commonly defined outcomes in ways appropriate to their pedagogy, including having the same outcome discoverable at different locations in the organizational hierarchy.

While an outcome can be linked into a context (such as a course) multiple times, it may only be linked into a particular group once.

An OutcomeGroup object looks like:

{
  // the ID of the outcome group
  "id": 1,
  // the URL for fetching/updating the outcome group. should be treated as opaque
  "url": "/api/v1/accounts/1/outcome_groups/1",
  // an abbreviated OutcomeGroup object representing the parent group of this
  // outcome group, if any. omitted in the abbreviated form.
  "parent_outcome_group": null,
  // the context owning the outcome group. may be null for global outcome groups.
  // omitted in the abbreviated form.
  "context_id": 1,
  "context_type": "Account",
  // title of the outcome group
  "title": "Outcome group title",
  // description of the outcome group. omitted in the abbreviated form.
  "description": "Outcome group description",
  // A custom GUID for the learning standard.
  "vendor_guid": "customid9000",
  // the URL for listing/creating subgroups under the outcome group. should be
  // treated as opaque
  "subgroups_url": "/api/v1/accounts/1/outcome_groups/1/subgroups",
  // the URL for listing/creating outcome links under the outcome group. should be
  // treated as opaque
  "outcomes_url": "/api/v1/accounts/1/outcome_groups/1/outcomes",
  // the URL for importing another group into this outcome group. should be
  // treated as opaque. omitted in the abbreviated form.
  "import_url": "/api/v1/accounts/1/outcome_groups/1/import",
  // whether the current user can update the outcome group
  "can_edit": true
}

An OutcomeLink object looks like:

{
  // the URL for fetching/updating the outcome link. should be treated as opaque
  "url": "/api/v1/accounts/1/outcome_groups/1/outcomes/1",

PUT /api/v1/courses/:course_id/outcome_groups/:id/outcomes/:outcome_id

Scope: url:PUT|/api/v1/courses/:course_id/outcome_groups/:id/outcomes/:outcome_id

Link an outcome into the outcome group. The outcome to link can either be specified by a PUT to the link URL for a specific outcome (the outcome_id in the PUT URLs) or by supplying the information for a new outcome (title, description, ratings, mastery_points) in a POST to the collection.

If linking an existing outcome, the outcome_id must identify an outcome available to this context; i.e. an outcome owned by this group’s context, an outcome owned by an associated account, or a global outcome. With outcome_id present, any other parameters (except move_from) are ignored.

If defining a new outcome, the outcome is created in the outcome group’s context using the provided title, description, ratings, and mastery points; the title is required but all other fields are optional. The new outcome is then linked into the outcome group.

If ratings are provided when creating a new outcome, an embedded rubric criterion is included in the new outcome. This criterion’s mastery_points default to the maximum points in the highest rating if not specified in the mastery_points parameter. Any ratings lacking a description are given a default of “No description”. Any ratings lacking a point value are given a default of 0. If no ratings are provided, the mastery_points parameter is ignored.

Scope: url:POST|/api/v1/courses/:course_id/outcome_groups/:id/import

Creates a new subgroup of the outcome group with the same title and description as the source group, then creates links in that new subgroup to the same outcomes that are linked in the source group. Recurses on the subgroups of the source group, importing them each in turn into the new subgroup.

Allows you to copy organizational structure, but does not create copies of the outcomes themselves, only new links.

The source group must be either global, from the same context as this outcome group, or from an associated account. The source group cannot be the root outcome group of its context.

Request Parameters:
Parameter
Type
Description

source_outcome_group_id

Required integer

The ID of the source outcome group.

async

boolean

If true, perform action asynchronously. In that case, this endpoint will return a Progress object instead of an OutcomeGroup. Use the progress endpoint to query the status of the operation. The imported outcome group id and url will be returned in the results of the Progress object as “outcome_group_id” and “outcome_group_url”

Outcome Imports

Welcome to Our New API Docs! This is the new home for all things API (previously at Canvas LMS REST API Documentation).
Outcome Imports API

API for importing outcome data

An OutcomeImportData object looks like:

{
  // The type of outcome import
  "import_type": "instructure_csv"
}

An OutcomeImport object looks like:

{
  // The unique identifier for the outcome import.
  "id": 1,
  // The unique identifier for the group into which the outcomes will be imported
  // to, or NULL.
  "learning_outcome_group_id": 1,
  // The date the outcome import was created.
  "created_at": "2013-12-01T23:59:00-06:00",
  // The date the outcome import finished. Returns null if not finished.
  "ended_at": "2013-12-02T00:03:21-06:00",
  // The date the outcome import was last updated.
  "updated_at": "2013-12-02T00:03:21-06:00",
  // The current state of the outcome import.
  // - 'created': The outcome import has been created.
  // - 'importing': The outcome import is currently processing.
  // - 'succeeded': The outcome import has completed successfully.
  // - 'failed': The outcome import failed.
  "workflow_state": "imported",
  // See the OutcomeImportData specification above.
  "data": null,
  // The progress of the outcome import.
  "progress": "100",
  // The user that initiated the outcome_import. See the Users API for details.
  "user": null,
  // An array of row number / error message pairs. Returns the first 25 errors.
  "processing_errors": [[1, "Missing required fields: title"]]

POST /api/v1/courses/:course_id/outcome_imports(/group/:learning_outcome_group_id)

Scope: url:POST|/api/v1/courses/:course_id/outcome_imports(/group/:learning_outcome_group_id)

Import outcomes into Canvas.

For more information on the format that’s expected here, please see the “Outcomes CSV” section in the API docs.

Request Parameters:
Parameter
Type
Description

import_type

string

Choose the data format for reading outcome data. With a standard Canvas install, this option can only be ‘instructure_csv’, and if unprovided, will be assumed to be so. Can be part of the query string.

attachment

string

There are two ways to post outcome import data - either via a multipart/form-data form-field-style attachment, or via a non-multipart raw post request.


‘attachment’ is required for multipart/form-data style posts. Assumed to be outcome data from a file upload form field named ‘attachment’.


Examples:


curl -F attachment=@<filename> -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" <br>    'https://<canvas>/api/v1/accounts/<account_id>/outcome_imports?import_type=instructure_csv'
curl -F attachment=@<filename> -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" <br>    'https://<canvas>/api/v1/courses/<course_id>/outcome_imports?import_type=instructure_csv'


If you decide to do a raw post, you can skip the ‘attachment’ argument, but you will then be required to provide a suitable Content-Type header. You are encouraged to also provide the ‘extension’ argument.


Examples:


curl -H 'Content-Type: text/csv' --data-binary @<filename>.csv <br>    -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" <br>    'https://<canvas>/api/v1/accounts/<account_id>/outcome_imports?import_type=instructure_csv'
curl -H 'Content-Type: text/csv' --data-binary @<filename>.csv <br>    -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" <br>    'https://<canvas>/api/v1/courses/<course_id>/outcome_imports?import_type=instructure_csv'

extension

string

Recommended for raw post request style imports. This field will be used to distinguish between csv and other file format extensions that would usually be provided with the filename in the multipart post request scenario. If not provided, this value will be inferred from the Content-Type, falling back to csv-file format if all else fails.

Returns an OutcomeImport object.
