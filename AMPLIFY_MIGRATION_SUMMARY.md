# Amplify Gen 2 Migration Summary

## Overview
Your Twitter clone has been successfully migrated from Supabase/Postgres to AWS Amplify Gen 2. Here's what has been completed:

## ‚úÖ Completed Migration Tasks

### 1. **Data Model Migration**
- Translated entire Prisma schema to Amplify Gen 2 data model
- Added proper many-to-many relationships with explicit join tables:
  - Friendship (friends & requests; replaces following/followers)
  - UserLikes (for tweet likes)
  - UserRetweets (for retweets)
- Added missing relationships (retweetOf, retweetedVersions)
- Added secondary indexes for performance

### 2. **Authentication Migration**
- Migrated from custom JWT authentication to AWS Cognito
- Updated login/signup/logout components to use Amplify Auth
- Added email verification flow for new users
- Updated useAuth hook to sync Cognito users with DynamoDB

### 3. **Data Access Layer**
- Created comprehensive fetch utilities using Amplify GraphQL
- Implemented all CRUD operations for:
  - Users (profile updates, friendship actions: request/cancel/accept/decline/remove)
  - Tweets (create, delete, like/unlike, retweet)
  - Messages (create, delete)
  - Notifications (create, mark as read)
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing component interfaces

### 4. **Storage Integration**
- Integrated AWS S3 for media storage
- Updated upload utilities to use Amplify Storage
- Configured secure URL generation for images

### 5. **Component Updates**
- Updated authentication dialogs (login, signup, logout)
- Modified components to use new function signatures
- Updated React Query mutations to work with Amplify

### 6. **Cleanup**
- Removed old API routes (src/app/api)
- Removed Prisma configuration
- Uninstalled unnecessary dependencies (bcrypt, jose, @prisma/client)
- Updated package.json

## üîÑ Next Steps for Full Deployment

### 1. **Deploy Amplify Backend**
```bash
# For development/testing
npx ampx sandbox

# For production
npx ampx pipeline-deploy --branch main --app-id <your-app-id>
```

### 2. **Update Environment Configuration**
After deployment, you'll need to:
- Update `next.config.js` with your S3 bucket domain
- Ensure `amplify_outputs.json` has correct production values

### 3. **Data Migration**
If you have existing data in Postgres:
1. Export data from Postgres
2. Transform to match DynamoDB structure
3. Use AWS DynamoDB batch operations to import

### 4. **User Migration Strategy**
For existing users:
- Option 1: Force password reset for all users
- Option 2: Implement custom migration Lambda trigger in Cognito
- Option 3: Run dual authentication during transition period

### 5. **Testing Checklist**
- [ ] User registration with email verification
- [ ] User login/logout
- [ ] Creating tweets with text and images
- [ ] Liking/unliking tweets
- [ ] Retweeting/unretweeting
- [ ] Friend request lifecycle (send/cancel/accept/decline/remove)
- [ ] Sending messages
- [ ] Receiving notifications
- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Image uploads and display

## üìù Important Notes

### Authentication Changes
- Users now log in with email instead of username
- Passwords are managed by Cognito (more secure)
- Email verification is required for new accounts

### API Changes
- All REST endpoints replaced with GraphQL
- Real-time subscriptions available (not yet implemented)
- Optimistic updates implemented for better UX

### Data Model Differences
- User primary key is username (handle). Cognito sub is not used as the PK.
- Timestamps are automatically managed
- Relationships use explicit join tables

### Performance Considerations
- Added secondary indexes for common queries
- Implemented pagination support (needs testing)
- Consider implementing caching strategy

## üö® Known Issues to Address

1. **Search Functionality**: DynamoDB doesn't support full-text search natively. Consider:
   - Using Amazon OpenSearch for advanced search
   - Implementing prefix-based search
   - Using Amazon Comprehend for semantic search

2. **Random User Selection**: Current implementation fetches all users. For production:
   - Implement a more efficient randomization strategy
   - Consider using a Lambda function

3. **Pagination**: While supported in the schema, pagination needs to be properly implemented in components

4. **Real-time Updates**: Amplify supports GraphQL subscriptions for real-time updates (not implemented)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"User not found" errors**: Ensure users are created in DynamoDB after Cognito signup
2. **Image upload failures**: Check S3 bucket permissions and CORS settings
3. **Authentication errors**: Verify Cognito user pool settings and app client configuration

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Check Amplify status
npx ampx status

# View CloudFormation stack
npx ampx sandbox --outputs-file

# Test GraphQL queries
npx ampx generate graphql-client-code
```
